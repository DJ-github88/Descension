# Sample: Nordmark Race Rewrite (WoW-Style)

## Main Race Description

The stoic Nordmark of the frozen wastes have spent countless generations enduring a cold that would shatter lesser peoples. Secure in their impregnable longhouses carved into glacial cliffs, the Nordmark rarely ventured beyond the wintry peaks that mark the boundaries of their ancestral lands. Even so, when the darkness spread across the world and threatened to consume all who stood against it, the Nordmark offered their axes to the defense of the realms that sought their aid. The ferocious and unyielding Nordmark proved to be the backbone of the northern front lines and helped break the tide of darkness in battles that would be remembered in sagas for centuries.

Recently the Nordmark unearthed a series of ancient burial mounds that held the key to the secrets of their lost heritage—runes carved by hands long cold that spoke of warrior-kings who first dared to claim kingdoms from the endless white. Driven to discover the truth about his people's fabled origins, the High Thane of the Bloodhammer clan ordered that the Nordmark shift their focus from endless feuding to the preservation of ancient knowledge. The clan helped to create the Rune-Keeper's Halls, a group utterly devoted to plumbing the secrets of the ancestral spirits and delving out the truth of the Nordmark's fabled existence.

An integral part of the northern defense, the grim Nordmark armies have been called away to battle the forces that would freeze the very soul of the world. In these perilous times, the defense of the frozen kingdoms falls to brave Nordmark like you. The spirits of the Nordmark ancestors watch over you, and the eternal winter itself is your strength. The future of your people is in your hands.

## Bloodhammer Clan

Many Nordmark clans were shattered by the endless winters, but the mighty longhouses of the Bloodhammer, built on the bones of fallen enemies and the foundations of glaciers, have never fallen to the cold alone. A testament to the Nordmark's skill at wielding hammer and axe, the Bloodhammer fortresses were constructed in the deepest valleys where the wind howls through frozen canyons: expansive underground halls of berserkers, weapon-smiths, and warriors. While the northern lands have been weakened by centuries of blood feuds, the Bloodhammer of the Frost-Forges, led by Thane Kael Bloodhammer, are forging a new future in the eternal white.

The Bloodhammer tradition demands that every warrior forge their own weapon before their sixteenth winter—not a sword, but hammer or axe. The forging happens in absolute silence under the aurora, with no fire in the forge. They use only their own rage, the heat that burns in their bellies when the winter howls. When the steel cools, they mark it with their own blood. Then the weapon goes to battle. Only when it tastes an enemy's life does the ritual complete. The weapon becomes them. Every notch in the handle is a memory. Every chip is a story for the longhouse fire.

The walls of Bloodhammer longhouses are lined with weapons from warriors long dead. Each weapon tells a story—the hammer with wolf-fur handle belonged to someone who fought three days through a blizzard; the axe with the broken haft marks the weapon of one who held a pass alone against fifty. Old warriors claim these weapons still hunger, and sometimes in deep winter you can hear them whisper of battles yet to come.

The berserker rituals pass down through generations as secret rites that change the initiate fundamentally. Through trance states, Bloodhammer warriors enter a fury so complete that wounds that would kill others become nothing. Pain becomes fuel. When the rage takes hold, muscles swell, veins stand out like cords, breathing turns to a growl. But when it breaks, they return to themselves hollowed out, their humanity burned away, left pale and shaking.

Many Bloodhammer die young—not from enemy steel but from the rage itself. Their hearts simply give out. Honor is measured in kills counted, enemies crushed, songs sung about their deeds where the ancestors listen. Blood feuds settle in dawn duels with weapons that have never lost. Insults get settled before the sun clears the eastern peaks.

The Bloodhammer view the Rune-Keepers as whispering cowards who hide behind spirits because they're too weak to face the north with nothing but rage and steel. They consider the Frostbound to be frozen cowards who have forgotten the heat of battle, hiding in their glacier peaks with eyes that barely remember what it means to stand and fight. But when the blizzard howls, it is the Bloodhammer who are called. When meat is needed and the hunt fails, it is the Bloodhammer who provide. For all their mockery, the Bloodhammer are the ones who ensure the nordmark survive, and they know it.

## Rune Keeper Clan

Many Nordmark secrets were lost to the endless winters, but the ancient libraries of the Rune-Keepers, carved into frozen caves deep within the wastes, have never surrendered their knowledge to the cold. A marvel to the Nordmark's skill at preserving memory in ice and stone, the Rune-Keeper sanctuaries were constructed in places where ice has never melted: vast underground networks of seers, historians, and spirit-speakers. While the northern traditions have been weakened by centuries of change, the Rune-Keepers of the Frozen Halls, led by Seer Mara Rune-Touched, are weaving a new understanding of the eternal winter.

The oldest sagas speak of the first shaman-king who walked alone into the deepest winter and returned changed—their eyes saw not the present but threads of past and future woven together. That first keeper learned to read omens in ice patterns on glass, to hear dead ancestors in the aurora's dance, to carve runes that hold memory itself. The Rune-Keepers trace their bloodline to this ancestor, carrying what they call a gift, though some whisper it is a curse.

Before their eighteenth winter, every Rune-Keeper undertakes the vision quest—not a rite of passage, but a breaking, a remaking. They are taken to frozen caves deep in the wastes, places where ice has never melted, where cold burns with an intensity that sears. Here, alone in darkness broken only by aurora-light through cracks in the ice, they spend days without food or fire, sustained only by visions granted by the ancestors.

When the visions come, and they always come, the runes get carved into their flesh with needles made from the bones of previous keepers. Each rune marks a story learned, a secret kept, a debt owed to the dead. The carving is slow, deliberate, and permanent—knowledge that cannot be unlearned. These runes don't fade. They grow deeper with age, scars piling up like pages in a book written in flesh. Sometimes overlapping, creating new patterns and new meanings.

Rune-Keeper longhouses are libraries rather than armories. Their walls are lined with shelves of carved bone tablets. Their floors are marked with runic circles that glow faintly in firelight. Here, sagas are preserved not just in words but in memory-stones that whisper if you know how to listen. They are historians keeping records spanning millennia, judges whose rulings carry the weight of ancestral precedent, mediators who see disputes through dead eyes.

Rituals let them commune with spirits bound to ice and storm, speaking with ancestors who haven't passed on but linger in the spaces between breaths, in the silence of deep winter. But it costs. Every time a Rune-Keeper peers into fate or communes with the dead, they lose a piece of themselves—a memory burned away, a feeling they can no longer name. Some forget what warmth feels like. Others forget what it meant to love or hate. The ancestors don't care about their souls. They care about what can be seen for them.

The Rune-Keepers view the Bloodhammer as mindless beasts who have forgotten what it means to be human, whose rage is just an excuse to avoid thinking about how empty their lives become between battles. When the fury fades, what is left? Bloodhammer become hollow. The Rune-Keepers, through their transformations, become something else—something that sees beyond the hunger, beyond the cold, beyond the endless white.

They view the Frostbound with a complex mixture of pity and recognition. The Frostbound look at their runes and say they're marked by the same cold that marked them, just in a different way. The Rune-Keepers see kinship—their runes come from visions and ancestors, the Frostbound's scars come from surviving where nothing should survive. Both are marked by the eternal winter, but while the Frostbound let the cold remake their flesh, the Rune-Keepers let it remake their minds.

## Frostbound Clan

Many Nordmark settlements were abandoned to the endless white, but the outposts of the Frostbound, built on the very edge of the eternal winter where reality itself begins to freeze, have never surrendered to the storm alone. A testament to the Nordmark's skill at adapting to the impossible, the Frostbound fortifications were constructed in glacier peaks where wind never stops and the sun barely reaches: vast networks of underground tunnels carved into living ice. While the other Nordmark clans have been weakened by their feuds and traditions, the Frostbound of the Deep Ice, led by Scout Elder Nal Ice-Walker, are forging an existence that the north itself recognizes.

The sagas tell of scouts who went too far into the eternal winter, into places where cold doesn't just kill but transforms. They didn't return as they left—they came back changed, flesh hardened, breath no longer visible because their lungs learned to breathe the cold itself. The Frostbound claim descent from those altered scouts. Their bloodline carries the mark. Their tradition is one of the harshest.

Before they can take their place in the longhouse, every Frostbound spends three winters alone in the deepest wastes—places even Rune-Keepers won't go. These are not survival tests but initiations, a communion with cold so absolute it remakes the body. Through generations of this rite, their bloodline has adapted in ways that border on unnatural. Flesh grows harder each winter. Cold tolerance becomes legendary. Bodies shaped by the land itself.

Some say the eternal winter recognizes them, that the cold welcomes them home. Frostbound longhouses rise in the worst places—glacier peaks where wind never stops, valleys the sun barely reaches, places other Nordmark won't build. They are outposts, forward positions. Frostbound scout ahead, guide paths that only exist in winter, guard borders most can't even see. Their survival arts are passed down not from books, but from the land itself—how to read ice stories as they form, how to find food in frozen ground, how to endure cold that would shatter steel.

Endurance matters most. Honor is measured in winters survived, paths found through terrain that kills. Independence matters. In the deepest cold, relying on others means death.

But it costs. Each generation tolerates warmth less. Their hardened flesh cracks in temperatures others find comfortable. Skin splits wider. Bodies betray them in summer lands. Many Frostbound cannot leave the north—the transformation is too complete. Warmth becomes poison. Skin cracks and bleeds. Lungs struggle with air that holds heat. Some say their blood runs cold as ice, their hearts beat with glacier rhythm.

They are edge-dwellers, respected for their resilience but kept at distance. Something about the way their eyes barely focus on anything that isn't snow. The way their skin feels like stone that's been left out too long. Other Nordmark look at them and see what the cold does to those who stay too long. The Frostbound look back and see folk who have never truly met the north—not really. They fight it, bargain with it, live in its shadow. The Frostbound have let it in.

The Frostbound view the Bloodhammer as short-sighted warriors who fight the winter with rage and steel, but rage burns out and weapons break. The cold lasts forever. The Bloodhammer don't fight the white—they endure it for a while, then it takes them. The Frostbound became it.

They view the Rune-Keepers with a strange kinship, recognizing that both are marked by something that changes what it means to be human. The Rune-Keepers chose their transformation, went seeking visions. The Frostbound were sent into the wastes, and the wastes changed them whether they wanted them to or not. In the end, both are forever marked by the eternal winter.

The Frostbound have watched their kind who tried to return to civilization, their skin cracking and bleeding in the warmth until they fled back to the glaciers. They have seen old scouts who have forgotten what it meant to be soft, whose flesh feels more like ice than meat, who look at spring with suspicion like it's some kind of trap.

The north doesn't care who you were before. It only cares about who you become. The Frostbound have become the cold itself.
