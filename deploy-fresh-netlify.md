# EMERGENCY NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Problem
- Netlify at windtunnel.netlify.app is serving OLD CODE
- None of our token fixes, skills UI improvements, or recent changes are deployed
- The site is completely disconnected from current repository

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Manual Netlify Dashboard Fix
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/windtunnel/deploys
2. Click "Trigger deploy" -> "Deploy site"
3. If that doesn't work, go to Site Settings -> Build & Deploy
4. Check if it's connected to DJ-github88/Descension repository
5. Check if it's deploying from "master" branch
6. Check if build command is: `npm install && npm run build`
7. Check if publish directory is: `build`

### Option 2: Create Brand New Netlify Site
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to GitHub: DJ-github88/Descension
4. Set these settings:
   - Base directory: `vtt-react`
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
   - Branch: `master`

### Option 3: Use Our Local Build (FASTEST)
1. Run our local build: `npm run build` in vtt-react folder
2. Drag and drop the entire `build` folder to Netlify dashboard
3. This will deploy immediately with all our fixes

## Current Status
- ✅ Local build works perfectly with all fixes
- ✅ Code is in GitHub repository
- ❌ Netlify is not deploying new code
- ❌ windtunnel.netlify.app shows ancient version

## Files That Should Be On Netlify But Aren't
- deployment-test.html (created today)
- Updated index.html with timestamp
- All token dragging fixes
- Enhanced skills UI
- Updated netlify.toml configuration

## Next Steps
1. Access Netlify dashboard immediately
2. Either fix the existing site or create a new one
3. Verify deployment works by checking for deployment-test.html
