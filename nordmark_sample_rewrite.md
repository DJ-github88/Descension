# Sample: Nordmark Race Rewrite

## Main Race Description (In-Character Perspective)

**Written by: Battle-scarred Bloodhammer elder at longhouse fire during winter storm**

We stand taller than other folk because the north demands it. Shoulders broad enough to carry what winter takes. Our skin bears the map of our lives—scars from blades, wind-burn from storms, the pale mark of cold that never leaves. Frost falls from our lips even in the warmth of southern lands, a breath that crystallizes into ghosts of the white we survived. We braid our hair with bone and iron because we are made of both. Our eyes hold the color of the winter sky: blue when the storm breaks, gray when the blizzard holds, pale green when the aurora dances.

We trace our blood to warrior-kings who carved their names into glacier ice with hammers stained red. But we remember them not as stories, but as debts. Every clan carries burdens from before the common speech was born. Some carry ancient feuds, others sacred vows, still others the weight of kings who refused to die even when ice claimed their flesh. We are not merely human. The north remade us. Each winter hardened our flesh like steel. Each storm forged our will like weapons. We became something the cold recognizes as its own.

## Cultural Background

The wind screams outside our longhouse, carrying the voice of the glacier that buried my father and his father before him. Inside, the fire burns low—enough to see, not enough to warm. This is how we live. This is how we survive. My grandfather used to say that warmth makes you soft, that the north demands hardness because it intends to kill you. He survived five winters alone in the wastes before returning with his mind changed and his skin marked by frost that never faded. Now he's buried beneath cairn stones outside, where the snow refuses to settle properly. The stones whisper if you listen close. Not lies exactly, but truths that would break lesser folk.

Our clans bind everything. You might think clan is family, but it's deeper. It's which ancestor you claim, which debts your blood owes, which feuds demand your death. The Bloodhammer clan traces to the first warrior-king who stood against the endless white and carved his kingdom from frozen waste with nothing but rage and a red-stained hammer. The Rune-Keepers claim descent from shaman-kings who walked into the deepest winter and returned with eyes that saw past and future woven together. The Frostbound... they say their scouts went too far into the eternal winter and came back changed, flesh hardened and cold become part of them.

Each clan hates the others. Bloodhammers call Rune-Keepers whispering cowards who hide behind spirits. Rune-Keepers mock Bloodhammers as mindless beasts who've forgotten what it means to be human. Frostbound pity us both, looking down from their glacier peaks with eyes that barely remember what humanity feels like. But when the white comes, we all share the same fire and the same longhouse walls. The north doesn't care about clan feuds. It just kills anyone it can.

Children learn the clan web before they know their own names. Which bloodlines are bound by marriage-kin, which ones have spilled blood for five generations, which debts must be paid before honor can rest. I've seen six-year-olds recite feuds older than their grandfathers. We don't write things down often. The cold destroys paper. We carve our histories into runestones and speak them in tongues that predate common speech. Every rune tells a story. Every burial mound holds a debt.

The longhouse fire doesn't just warm. It shows who owes what, which stories must be told tonight, which spirits need appeasing. When you sit at a Nordmark fire, you're sitting with everyone who ever sat there before you.

We don't take land. We claim it. Clan banners mark territory won through blood and winter, each banner a grave marker for those who died holding the ground. Survival requires strength in the north. Respect requires honor. But honor is a debt that grows heavier each generation. Wrongs unavenged. Sagas left unfinished. Blood debts passed down like heirlooms. I've seen marriages end over a blood-debt from three generations back. I've seen clan wars that lasted until everyone involved had forgotten why they started fighting.

The traditions outlive empires because they work. Winter kills the weak. Only harsh ways keep folk alive up here.

When a Nordmark dies far from the longhouse fire, their spirit wanders the wastes seeking the light that leads to the ancestor halls. My grandmother claimed she saw her uncle's spirit, trapped in the ice for fifty years because he died raiding southern lands. She said the frost preserved his memory like meat in a cellar. But if you break a clan oath, that light never comes. Just endless white, wandering until the ice takes your name from memory itself. I've seen oathbreakers—they don't fear death. They fear being forgotten. They fear the cold that waits outside the longhouse walls, the cold that knows us all by name.

## Subrace: Bloodhammer

**Written by: Bloodhammer clan elder, three battles past his prime**

Our muscles earned their shape swinging hammers through bone. The brands on our forearms burned in during weapon rites still throb when storms come. Every scar tells a story of someone who died trying to kill us. When the fury takes our eyes, they burn red like the rage that carved kingdoms from frozen waste. We braid our hair with leather strips and old iron rings—each ring is a battle, each strip a dead enemy. Before our sixteenth winter, every Bloodhammer forges their own weapon. Not a sword. Hammer or axe. It becomes your life.

The sagas tell of the first warrior-king who stood alone against the endless white and carved his name into glacier ice with a hammer stained red. That hammer still hangs in the oldest Bloodhammer longhouse, handle wrapped in leather from his enemies' hides, metal dark with the rust of centuries. We claim direct descent. Our blood carries the fury that birthed kingdoms from frozen waste.

The forging happens in silence under the aurora. No fire in the forge—we use our own rage, the heat that burns in our bellies when the winter howls. When the steel cools, you mark it with your own blood. Then it goes to battle. Only when it tastes an enemy's life does the ritual complete. The weapon becomes you. Every notch in the handle is a memory. Every chip is a story for the longhouse fire.

Our longhouses are armories. Walls lined with hammers and axes from warriors long dead. Each weapon tells a story. The hammer with wolf-fur handle belonged to someone who fought three days through a blizzard. The axe with the broken haft marks the weapon of one who held a pass alone against fifty. Old warriors say these weapons still hunger. Sometimes in deep winter you hear them whisper of battles yet to come. Or maybe that's just the wind through old steel.

The berserker rituals pass down through generations. Secret rites that change you. Trance states where you enter a fury so complete that wounds that would kill others become nothing. Pain becomes fuel. When the rage takes hold, muscles swell, veins stand out like cords, breathing turns to a growl. But when it breaks, you return to yourself hollowed out. Your humanity burned away, left pale and shaking.

Many Bloodhammer die young. Not from enemy steel but from the rage itself. Hearts give out. Honor's measured in kills counted, enemies crushed, songs sung about your deeds where the ancestors listen. Blood feuds settle in dawn duels. Weapons that've never lost. Insults get settled before the sun clears the eastern peaks.

We fight because the north demands strength. We fight because our blood was forged in violence and remembers nothing else.

The Rune-Keepers mock us. They say we're mindless beasts who've forgotten what it means to be human, that our rage is just an excuse to avoid thinking about how empty our lives become between battles. They're wrong. They sit in their frozen caves whispering to dead ancestors while we do the work of surviving. Let them have their spirits. We have the strength that keeps the white at bay.

The Frostbound—they pity us, pity everyone. They look down from their glacier peaks with eyes that barely remember human feeling, judging us for being "bound to the surface" while they freeze themselves into something almost stone. But when the blizzard howls, who do they call? Who do they ask for meat when their hunt fails? Bloodhammer. Because we know what it means to spill blood and keep going.

I've seen boys of fifteen take their first hammers to battle and return with eyes that don't ever look the same again. I've seen old warriors who've burned through every bit of humanity and now just wait for the rage to take them for the last time.

The north doesn't care about souls. It cares about who's strong enough to live. We're the ones strong enough. The rest talk.

## Subrace: Rune Keeper

**Written by: Rune Keeper with eyes that look through you**

The oldest sagas speak of the first shaman-king who walked alone into the deepest winter and returned changed. Their eyes saw not the present but threads of past and future woven together. That first keeper learned to read omens in ice patterns on glass, to hear dead ancestors in the aurora's dance, to carve runes that hold memory itself. We trace our bloodline to this ancestor. Same gift. Or curse.

Before your eighteenth winter, you do the vision quest. Not a rite of passage. A breaking. A remaking. They take you to frozen caves deep in the wastes, places where ice has never melted, where cold burns with an intensity that sears. Here, alone in darkness broken only by aurora-light through cracks in the ice, you spend days without food or fire. Sustained only by visions granted by the ancestors.

When they come, and they always come, the runes get carved into your flesh with needles made from the bones of previous keepers. Each rune marks a story learned, a secret kept, a debt owed to the dead. The carving's slow. Deliberate. Each mark is permanent. Knowledge that cannot be unlearned. These runes don't fade. They grow deeper with age, scars piling up like pages in a book written in flesh. Sometimes overlapping, creating new patterns. New meanings.

Our longhouses are libraries. Walls lined with shelves of carved bone tablets. Floors marked with runic circles that glow faintly in firelight. Here, sagas are preserved not just in words but in memory-stones that whisper if you know how to listen. We're historians keeping records spanning millennia. Judges whose rulings carry the weight of ancestral precedent. Mediators who see disputes through dead eyes.

Rituals let us commune with spirits bound to ice and storm, speaking with ancestors who haven't passed on but linger in the spaces between breaths, in the silence of deep winter. But it costs. Every time you peer into fate, commune with the dead, you lose a piece of yourself. A memory burned away. A feeling you can no longer name. Some of us forget what warmth feels like. Others forget what it meant to love or hate. The ancestors don't care about your soul. They care about what you can see for them.

The Bloodhammers mock us. They call us whispering cowards who hide behind spirits because they're too weak to face the north with nothing but rage and steel. They don't understand. When the fury fades, what's left? Bloodhammer become hollow. We become something else. Something that sees beyond the hunger, beyond the cold, beyond the endless white. They fight the winter. We learn its language.

The Frostbound—they look at our runes and say we're marked by the same cold that marked them, just in a different way. They're not entirely wrong. Our scars come from visions and ancestors. Their scars come from surviving where nothing should survive. Both of us marked by the eternal winter. But they let the cold remake their flesh. We let it remake their minds.

I've seen apprentices who couldn't handle the visions, whose minds fractured under the weight of too many futures seen. I've seen old keepers who've forgotten their own names, remember only the ancestors and what those ancestors still want. The runes keep growing. The visions keep coming. Someday there'll be nothing left of the person who started, just the runes and the ancestors' voices whispering through lips that barely remember how to speak for themselves.

The north doesn't want your strength. It wants your understanding. We're the ones who understand. The rest survive.

## Subrace: Frostbound

**Written by: Frostbound scout who spent seven winters alone in the eternal white**

The sagas tell of scouts who went too far into the eternal winter, into places where cold doesn't just kill but transforms. They didn't return as they left. They came back changed, flesh hardened, breath no longer visible because their lungs learned to breathe the cold itself. We claim descent from those altered scouts. Our bloodline carries the mark. Our tradition's one of the harshest.

Before you can take your place in the longhouse, you spend three winters alone in the deepest wastes. Places even Rune-Keepers won't go. Not survival tests. Initiations. Communion with cold so absolute it remakes your body. Through generations of this rite, our bloodline adapted in ways that border on unnatural. Flesh grows harder each winter. Cold tolerance becomes legendary. Bodies shaped by the land itself.

Some say the eternal winter recognizes us. The cold welcomes us home. Our longhouses rise in the worst places. Glacier peaks where wind never stops. Valleys the sun barely reaches. Places other Nordmark won't build. Outposts. We scout ahead, guide paths that only exist in winter, guard borders most can't even see. Survival arts passed down. Not from books—from the land. How to read ice stories as they form. How to find food in frozen ground. How to endure cold that'd shatter steel.

Endurance matters most. Honor measured in winters survived, paths found through terrain that kills. Independence matters. In the deepest cold, relying on others means death.

But it costs. Each generation tolerates warmth less. Hardened flesh cracks in temperatures others find comfortable. Skin splits wider. Bodies betray them in summer lands. Many of us can't leave the north. Transformation's too complete. Warmth becomes poison. Skin cracks and bleeds. Lungs struggle with air that holds heat. Some say our blood runs cold as ice. Hearts beat with glacier rhythm.

We're edge-dwellers. Respected for resilience, kept at distance. Something about the way our eyes barely focus on anything that isn't snow. The way our skin feels like stone that's been left out too long. Other Nordmark look at us and see what the cold does to those who stay too long. We look at them and see folk who've never truly met the north. Not really. They fight it, bargain with it, live in its shadow. We've let it in.

The Bloodhammers mock us as "frozen cowards" who hide in the deepest wastes rather than face the winter with rage and steel. They don't understand. Rage burns out. Weapons break. The cold lasts forever. We don't fight the white. We became it.

The Rune-Keepers—they look at our flesh and their eyes go distant, seeing some kinship. Their runes come from visions. Our scars come from ice that carved us new. Both of us marked by something that changes what it means to be human. But they chose their transformation. They went seeking visions. We were sent into the wastes, and the wastes changed us whether we wanted them to or not.

I've watched Frostbound who tried to return to civilization, their skin cracking and bleeding in the warmth until they fled back to the glaciers. I've seen old scouts who've forgotten what it meant to be soft, whose flesh feels more like ice than meat, who look at spring with suspicion like it's some kind of trap.

The north doesn't care who you were before. It only cares about who you become. We became the cold itself. The rest still pretend they can choose.
