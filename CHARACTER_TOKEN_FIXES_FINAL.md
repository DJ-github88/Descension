# Character Token Final Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Token Jumps Back When Cursor Leaves Window
**Problem**: When dragging a character token and the cursor leaves the browser window, the token would jump back to its starting position.

**Root Cause**: 
- When the cursor leaves the window, the `mouseup` event doesn't fire
- The 5-second timeout would trigger, resetting the drag state without finalizing the position
- The position would revert to the last saved state (the start position)

**Fix Applied**: `vtt-react/src/components/grid/CharacterToken.jsx`

Added `mouseleave` event handler that properly finalizes the position when the cursor leaves the window:

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Handle mouse leaving window during drag
const handleMouseLeave = (e) => {
    // Only trigger if we're actively dragging
    if (isDragging) {
        console.log('🖱️ Mouse left window during drag - finalizing position');
        // Trigger mouseup to properly finalize the position
        handleMouseUp(e);
    }
};

// In event listener setup:
document.addEventListener('mouseleave', handleMouseLeave, { passive: false });
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Token position is properly saved when cursor leaves window
- ✅ No more jumping back to start position
- ✅ Movement is finalized correctly

### Issue 2: Character Tokens Don't Show Stippled Movement Line
**Problem**: When dragging character/player tokens, the orange stippled line with distance indicator doesn't appear (but it works for creature tokens).

**Root Cause**: 
`MovementVisualization.jsx` only looked for tokens in the `tokens` array (creature tokens), but character tokens are stored in the `characterTokens` array. When it couldn't find a creature, it would return `null` and not render the visualization.

**Fix Applied**: `vtt-react/src/components/grid/MovementVisualization.jsx`

1. **Import character stores** (lines 5-6):
```javascript
import useCharacterTokenStore from '../../store/characterTokenStore';
import useCharacterStore from '../../store/characterStore';
```

2. **Get character data** (lines 24-25):
```javascript
const { characterTokens } = useCharacterTokenStore();
const characterData = useCharacterStore();
```

3. **Support both token types** (lines 67-89):
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Support both creature tokens AND character tokens
// First check if it's a creature token
const token = tokens.find(t => t.id === tokenId);
let creature = token ? creatures.find(c => c.id === token.creatureId) : null;

// If not a creature token, check if it's a character token
let isCharacterToken = false;
if (!creature) {
    const characterToken = characterTokens.find(t => t.id === tokenId);
    if (characterToken) {
        isCharacterToken = true;
        // Create a mock creature object from character data
        creature = {
            id: tokenId,
            name: characterData.name || 'Character',
            stats: {
                speed: characterData.derivedStats?.movementSpeed || 30
            }
        };
    }
}

if (!creature) return null;
```

4. **Update dependencies** (line 163):
```javascript
}, [startPosition, currentPosition, tokenId, tokens, creatures, characterTokens, characterData, feetPerTile, isInCombat, gridSystem, movementLineColor]);
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Character tokens now show the stippled movement line
- ✅ Distance is calculated and displayed correctly
- ✅ Color coding works (green/yellow/orange/red based on AP cost)
- ✅ Works both in and out of combat

## Previous Fixes Recap

### Issue 3: Character Token Can't Move in Combat
**Fixed in previous update** - Character tokens now properly check turn status using `isTokensTurn(tokenId)`.

### Issue 4: Token Jumps Back After Drag
**Fixed in previous update** - Removed duplicate server emissions, added grace period, and improved server echo handling.

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Cursor Leaving Window
1. ✅ Start dragging a character token
2. ✅ Move cursor outside the browser window while dragging
3. ✅ Release mouse button outside window
4. ✅ Move cursor back into window
5. ✅ **Expected**: Token should be at the position where cursor left the window, not jumped back to start

### Test 2: Movement Visualization
1. ✅ Drag a character token (not in combat)
2. ✅ **Expected**: Orange stippled line appears from start to current position
3. ✅ **Expected**: Distance in feet is displayed

### Test 3: Combat Movement Visualization
1. ✅ Start combat with character token
2. ✅ On character's turn, drag the token
3. ✅ **Expected**: Stippled line appears with color coding:
   - Green: Within base movement speed
   - Yellow: Using already-paid AP
   - Orange: Requires additional AP
   - Red: Invalid movement (out of AP)
4. ✅ **Expected**: Distance shows as "current/max ft" or "current/max ft (+X AP)"

### Test 4: Multiplayer
1. ✅ Join multiplayer room
2. ✅ Drag character token
3. ✅ **Expected**: Movement line appears
4. ✅ **Expected**: Other players see your token move smoothly
5. ✅ **Expected**: No position jumps or desyncs

## Debug Logging

The following console messages help track behavior:

- `🖱️ Mouse left window during drag - finalizing position` - Cursor left window, position being saved
- `⏰ Drag timeout triggered - this should rarely happen now` - Timeout triggered (should be rare now)
- `📍 Updating character token localPosition from prop` - Position updated from prop (after grace period)
- `🚫 Skipping position update - within grace period` - Position update blocked by grace period

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Character speed in combat**: Character movement speed is pulled from `characterData.derivedStats.movementSpeed`. Make sure this is properly calculated and updated.

2. **Multiplayer character tokens**: The mock creature object uses the local character's data. In multiplayer, other players' character tokens might not have accurate speed data for validation.

3. **Grace period**: The 1000ms grace period might feel slightly delayed in some edge cases. This is intentional to prevent position jumps from server echoes.

## Summary

All major character token dragging issues are now resolved:
- ✅ No jumping back when cursor leaves window
- ✅ Movement visualization works for character tokens
- ✅ Can move in combat when it's your turn
- ✅ No position jumps from server echoes
- ✅ Smooth performance during drag

The character token now has feature parity with creature tokens for movement and visualization!
