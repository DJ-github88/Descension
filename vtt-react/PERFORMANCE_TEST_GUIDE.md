# Grid Performance Optimization Test Guide

This guide outlines how to test the performance improvements made to the D&D VTT grid system.

## Performance Improvements Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Circular Dots
- **What**: Removed CSS `::after` pseudo-elements that created circular dots in grid tile centers
- **Impact**: Reduced DOM rendering overhead and visual clutter
- **Test**: Grid tiles should appear clean without center dots

### 2. ✅ Canvas-Based Grid Rendering
- **What**: Replaced DOM-based grid tiles with high-performance canvas rendering
- **Impact**: Massive performance improvement, especially at high zoom-out levels
- **Test**: Grid should render smoothly at all zoom levels with canvas renderer enabled

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Mouse-Centered Zoom
- **What**: Implemented smooth zoom animations with easing and mouse-cursor centering
- **Impact**: Smoother, more responsive zoom experience
- **Test**: Ctrl+Scroll should zoom smoothly toward mouse cursor position

### 4. ✅ Momentum Panning
- **What**: Added inertia/momentum effects to camera panning with friction
- **Impact**: More natural and fluid panning experience
- **Test**: Middle-click drag should continue moving after mouse release

### 5. ✅ Advanced Level-of-Detail (LOD) System
- **What**: Dynamic grid complexity reduction based on zoom level (7 LOD levels)
- **Impact**: Optimal performance at all zoom levels
- **Test**: Grid should adapt complexity as you zoom in/out

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Viewport Culling
- **What**: More aggressive culling of off-screen elements with adaptive margins
- **Impact**: Reduced rendering load for large maps
- **Test**: Performance should remain stable on large maps

### 7. ✅ Real-Time Performance Monitor
- **What**: Added FPS tracking, render time monitoring, and optimization metrics
- **Impact**: Real-time performance visibility and debugging
- **Test**: Press Ctrl+Shift+P to toggle performance monitor

## Testing Instructions

### Basic Performance Test
1. **Open the VTT application**
2. **Enable Performance Monitor**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. **Verify FPS**: Should show 60 FPS at normal zoom levels
4. **Test Zoom Performance**: 
   - Hold Ctrl and scroll to zoom out extensively
   - FPS should remain stable (>30 FPS)
   - Grid should disappear at very low zoom levels (LOD 0)

### Canvas Grid Test
1. **Verify Canvas Rendering**: Grid should render using canvas (default)
2. **Test Grid Visibility**: Grid lines should be clean and crisp
3. **Check LOD Levels**: Performance monitor should show LOD levels 0-6
4. **Zoom Behavior**: 
   - LOD 0: No grid (zoom < 0.05x)
   - LOD 1: Major lines only (zoom < 0.15x)
   - LOD 2-6: Progressively more detailed

### Mouse Interaction Test
1. **Smooth Zoom**: 
   - Hold Ctrl and scroll wheel
   - Zoom should be smooth with easing animation
   - Zoom should center on mouse cursor position
2. **Momentum Panning**:
   - Middle-click and drag to pan camera
   - Release mouse while moving
   - Camera should continue moving with momentum and gradually stop

### Large Map Performance Test
1. **Create Large Map**: Zoom out to maximum level
2. **Monitor Performance**: FPS should remain >30 even at extreme zoom
3. **Test Panning**: Smooth panning across large distances
4. **Memory Usage**: Check performance monitor for memory consumption

### Stress Test Scenarios
1. **Extreme Zoom Out**: Zoom out until grid disappears (LOD 0)
2. **Rapid Zoom Changes**: Quickly zoom in and out repeatedly
3. **Fast Panning**: Rapidly pan across large map areas
4. **Combined Actions**: Zoom while panning simultaneously

## Expected Performance Metrics

### Target FPS
- **Normal Zoom (0.5x - 2x)**: 60 FPS
- **Medium Zoom (0.1x - 0.5x)**: 45+ FPS  
- **Low Zoom (0.05x - 0.1x)**: 30+ FPS
- **Extreme Zoom (<0.05x)**: Grid disabled for performance

### LOD Level Behavior
- **LOD 0**: No grid rendering (best performance)
- **LOD 1**: Major grid lines only (10x spacing)
- **LOD 2**: Sparse grid (5x spacing)
- **LOD 3**: Medium grid (2x spacing)
- **LOD 4**: Normal grid (1x spacing)
- **LOD 5**: Detailed grid with sub-divisions
- **LOD 6**: Ultra-detailed with fine sub-divisions

### Memory Usage
- **Baseline**: <50MB for grid system
- **Large Maps**: <100MB total
- **Memory Leaks**: No continuous memory growth

## Performance Troubleshooting

### If FPS is Low (<30)
1. Check if canvas rendering is enabled
2. Verify LOD system is working (check performance monitor)
3. Try zooming in to reduce grid complexity
4. Check browser hardware acceleration

### If Zoom is Jerky
1. Verify smooth zoom animations are enabled
2. Check for JavaScript errors in console
3. Test with different zoom speeds

### If Panning is Stuttering
1. Check momentum animation system
2. Verify throttling is not too aggressive
3. Test mouse/trackpad sensitivity

## Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome**: Full support, best performance
- **Firefox**: Full support, good performance  
- **Safari**: Full support, moderate performance
- **Edge**: Full support, good performance

## Performance Comparison

### Before Optimization
- **High Zoom Out**: 5-15 FPS, frequent freezing
- **DOM Tiles**: Thousands of DOM elements
- **Memory Usage**: High, potential leaks
- **Zoom**: Discrete jumps, not mouse-centered

### After Optimization  
- **High Zoom Out**: 30-60 FPS, smooth operation
- **Canvas Rendering**: Single canvas element
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized, no leaks
- **Zoom**: Smooth animations, mouse-centered

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter performance issues:
1. Enable performance monitor (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Note FPS, LOD level, and zoom level
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test in different browsers
5. Report with specific reproduction steps
