# Talent Tree Visual Fixes - WoW Classic Style

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Icon Visibility Problem ✅
**Problem**: Talent icons were too dark/obscured by the background overlay

**Solution**:
- Reduced background overlay opacity from 85% to 15%
- Changed from `rgba(248, 244, 230, 0.85)` to `rgba(248, 244, 230, 0.15)`
- Icons are now clearly visible against the backdrop

### 2. Arrow Overlap and Spacing ✅
**Problem**: Arrows were overlapping with talent icons and looked cramped

**Solution**:
- Adjusted grid spacing: Changed from 120x120px to 100x100px cells
- Reduced talent icon size: Changed from 80x80px to 64x64px
- Recalculated arrow offsets to start/end 34px from talent center (2px spacing)
- Arrows now have proper clearance from talent borders

### 3. Arrow Thickness and Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Arrows were too thin and hard to see

**Solution**:
- Increased arrow line width from 4px to 6px
- Increased arrow head size (9px borders instead of 7px)
- Added gradient backgrounds to arrows for depth
- Enhanced shadows and inset highlights

### 4. Arrow States ✅
**Problem**: Active/inactive arrow states weren't distinct enough

**Solution**:
- **Inactive Arrows**: 
  - Brown color (#5d4e37)
  - 50% opacity (increased from 35%)
  - Subtle shadows
  
- **Active Arrows**:
  - Green color (#4CAF50) - matches learned talent border
  - Full opacity with gradient
  - Glowing pulse animation
  - Enhanced drop shadows

## Visual Improvements

### WoW Classic Style Arrows
- **Long Vertical Arrows**: Proper spacing between tiers
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Depth and dimension
- **Inset Highlights**: 3D appearance
- **Pulse Animation**: Subtle glow on active arrows

### Better Spacing
```
Before: 120x120px cells, 80x80px talents
After:  100x100px cells, 64x64px talents
Result: More breathing room, clearer arrow paths
```

### Arrow Calculation
```javascript
// Start from bottom of source talent
fromY = position.y * 100 + 50 + 34  // Center + half talent + 2px spacing

// End at top of target talent  
toY = position.y * 100 + 50 - 34    // Center - half talent - 2px spacing

// Result: Clean arrow that doesn't overlap talent borders
```

## Color Scheme

### Inactive Arrows
- **Color**: Brown (#5d4e37)
- **Opacity**: 50%
- **Shadow**: Subtle drop shadow
- **Meaning**: Prerequisite not learned

### Active Arrows
- **Color**: Green (#4CAF50)
- **Opacity**: 100%
- **Glow**: Pulsing animation
- **Meaning**: Prerequisite learned, path unlocked

### Talent States
- **Locked**: Grayscale, dark
- **Learnable**: Gold border (#D4AF37)
- **Learned**: Green border (#4CAF50)
