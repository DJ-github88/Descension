# Talent Tree Updates - Summary Tab & Prerequisite Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Prerequisite Logic ✅
**Issue**: Talents were unlocking when prerequisite talents had ANY points invested, not when they were fully maxed out.

**Solution**: Updated `canLearnTalent()` function to check if prerequisite talents are at MAX ranks before unlocking dependent talents.

**Implementation**:
- Single prerequisite: Must have `currentRanks >= maxRanks`
- Multiple prerequisites (AND logic): ALL must be fully maxed
- Multiple prerequisites (OR logic): At least ONE must be fully maxed
- Still respects the `requiresPoints` tier requirement

**Example**:
- Fire Intensity (3/3 max ranks) → Must be 3/3 before unlocking dependent talents
- Previously: Would unlock at 1/3 or 2/3 ❌
- Now: Only unlocks when fully invested at 3/3 ✅

### 2. Added Summary Tab ✅
**Feature**: New "Summary" tab that displays all learned talents across all three specialization trees in a clean, organized layout.

**Features**:
- **Tab Navigation**: 4th tab labeled "Summary" appears after the three specialization tabs
- **Tree Organization**: Talents grouped by specialization tree
- **Points Display**: Shows total points invested per tree
- **Dynamic Descriptions**: Uses the same `getDynamicDescription()` function to show scaled values
- **Visual Layout**: 
  - Talent icon with rank badge (e.g., "2/3")
  - Talent name and description
  - Hover effects for better UX
- **Empty State**: Shows helpful message when no talents are learned
- **Reset All Button**: Allows resetting all talents from the summary view

**CSS Styling**:
- Pathfinder beige theme matching the rest of the talent tree
- Card-based layout for each tree section
- Responsive hover effects
- Clean typography with proper hierarchy
- Icon badges showing current/max ranks

---

### 3. Dynamic Tooltip Values (Previous Update)
- Tooltips now show actual scaled values based on current rank
- "1d4 per rank" becomes "3d4" at rank 3
- "+1 damage per rank" becomes "+3 damage" at rank 3

### 4. Removed Tier Separators (Previous Update)
- Removed horizontal line breakers between talent rows
- Allows connecting arrows to flow smoothly without visual interruption

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Prerequisite Testing**:
   - Verify talents with 3 max ranks require 3/3 before unlocking dependents
   - Test AND logic with multiple prerequisites
   - Test OR logic with multiple prerequisites
   - Confirm tier point requirements still work

2. **Summary Tab Testing**:
   - Learn talents across multiple trees
   - Verify they appear in correct tree sections
   - Check point totals are accurate
   - Test "Reset All" button
   - Verify empty state shows when no talents learned

3. **Visual Testing**:
   - Check tooltip positioning on Summary tab
   - Verify hover effects work correctly
   - Ensure responsive layout on different window sizes
   - Confirm pathfinder beige theme is consistent
