        description: 'Folk with eyes that gleam yellow like animals. Bodies that shift subtly, hints of the beast always visible. Hands sometimes show claws or fur. Teeth sharper than normal. They smell of animal musk and wild places. Many have scars from their first transformation. Movement carries predatory grace. They have trouble staying indoors for long.',

        overview: 'The Vreken are people whose ancestors broke the old taboos. Drank from forbidden springs. Bound their bloodlines to beast-transformation through cursed rituals. Through generations of carrying the beast within, their bloodlines have been marked by the transformation curse. Eyes that gleam with animal cunning. Bodies that shift between human and beast. They are organized into packs that roam the wild borders between civilization and savagery. Settlements hidden in caves and ruined towers. The Vreken do not choose to transform. It is their heritage, passed down through bloodlines that carry the curse of the beast.',
        culturalBackground: `Vreken society is built on packs that roam the wild borders between civilization and savagery. Communities organized around managing the curse that binds them. Each pack traces its founding to ancestors who broke the old taboos. Drank from forbidden springs. Bound their bloodlines to beast-transformation. Their camps are hidden in caves or ruined towers. Places where the boundary between man and animal frays. Pack elders pass down the old ways. How to control the transformation. How to master the beast. How to survive the curse that claims so many. Children are taught from birth to recognize the signs. The yellow gleam in the eyes. The sudden hunger for raw meat. The dreams of running on four legs through endless forests. A Vreken first change is agony. Bones cracking. Flesh tearing. The human mind drowning in animal instinct. Some learn to master the beast. Using its strength while keeping their humanity intact. Others lose themselves entirely. Becoming monsters that hunt their own kind. Pack disputes settle through hunts and the testimony of those who have mastered the curse. Many Vreken end their days in self-imposed exile. Chaining themselves during full moons to prevent the change that would claim them forever. They are a people bound by curse and beast. Their transformation unmatched but their humanity forever threatened by the animal within.`,
        variantDiversity: 'The Vreken are divided into two major pack bloodlines: The Beast-Bound embrace their predatory nature and bestial instincts, while the Chain-Bound seek control and struggle to maintain their humanity against the transformation.',
