        description: 'Antlered forest folk with bark-like skin in patches. Hair grows like moss and vines. Antlers sprout from their heads, some small, some branching like trees. Eyes hold the green of deep forests. Feet calloused and tough, many walk barefoot even in winter. They smell of earth and growing things. Their presence makes plants grow faster nearby.',

        overview: 'The Groven are people whose ancestors made bonds with the primal forces of nature. Their bloodlines marked by the wild through generations. They are organized into groves and tribes bound to ancient forests. Settlements grown from living trees that remember every promise made. The Groven do not choose to be guardians. It is their heritage, passed down through bloodlines that hear the forest call.',
        culturalBackground: `Groven society is built on bonds with ancient groves and the primal forces of nature. Communities organized into tribes bound to specific forests. Each grove traces its founding to legendary guardians who first made pacts with the old spirits. Traditions enforcing the bonds given centuries ago. Groven settlements are grown from living trees. Bark-homes connected to the grove roots. Antlers sprouting from the same primal energy that feeds the forest. Children are taught from birth to hear the forest voice. Not in words, but in the rustle of leaves and the creak of branches. Grove elders pass down the old ways. How to speak with trees. How to call upon primal spirits. How to become one with the wild. Their courts are held in sacred circles where the boundary between flesh and bark blurs. Warriors becoming weapons. Bodies twisting into living wood and thorn. Grove disputes settle through trials of nature and the testimony of ancient trees that remember every bond made. They are a people bound by grove and spirit. Their connection to nature unmatched but their souls forever tied to the wild places they protect.`,
        variantDiversity: 'The Groven are divided into three major grove bloodlines: The Grove-Guardians dedicate themselves to protecting ancient forests, the Trail-Walkers follow seasonal migrations as nomadic wanderers, and the Spirit-Speakers commune with primal spirits and channel ancient nature magic.',
