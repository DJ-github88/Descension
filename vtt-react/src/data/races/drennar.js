        description: 'Folk with bodies deformed by crushing pressure. Bones warped, joints that move wrong. Skin glows with bioluminescent patterns from infected scars. Eyes adapted to absolute darkness, pupils huge. They move slowly, joints protesting normal movement. Their bodies struggle with surface gravity. Many avoid bright light, their skin sensitive from deep dwelling.',

        overview: 'The Drennar are people whose ancestors survived underwater disasters. Miners trapped in flooded tunnels. Sailors dragged to crushing depths. Divers who stayed too long in the abyss. Through generations of living in pressure-damaged bodies, their bloodlines have been marked by deep-sea trauma. Deformed skeletons. Crushed organs. Skin that glows from bacterial infections passed down through generations. They are organized into communities built around abandoned mines and sunken wrecks. Settlements clustered where the pressure-damaged can survive. The Drennar do not choose to glow. It is their heritage, passed down through bloodlines that carry the corruption of deep-sea wounds.',
        culturalBackground: `Drennar society is built on communities clustered around abandoned mines and sunken wrecks. Settlements built where pressure-damaged bodies can survive. Each community traces its lineage to survivors of legendary disasters. Miners trapped in flooded tunnels. Sailors dragged to crushing depths. Divers who stayed too long in the abyss. Their settlements cluster in places where the crushing dark is familiar. Inhabitants living proof that some survive the depths. Though perhaps they should not have. Community elders pass down the old ways. How to survive pressure changes. How to read deep-sea currents. How to function despite deformed bodies. The glowing patterns on their skin are not decoration. They are infected scars from pressure injuries. Bioluminescent bacteria that colonized their damaged tissue. Passed down through generations. Their slow movements are not patience but permanent damage. Joints crushed by pressure. Bones that never healed right. Community disputes settle through pressure-trials and the testimony of those who have survived the deepest dives. They avoid the surface not from preference but necessity. Their deformed bodies struggle with normal gravity. Pressure-damaged lungs cannot handle thin air. They are a people bound by depth and survival. Their knowledge of the abyss unmatched but their bodies forever marked by the pressure that shaped them.`,
        variantDiversity: 'The Drennar are divided into three major community bloodlines: The Crush-Scarred bear permanent deformities from surviving the crushing abyss, the Abyss-Walkers adapted to deep-sea environments through generations of suffering, and the Pressure-Torn survived rapid pressure changes that left them unstable.',
        integrationNotes: {
            actionPointSystem: 'Drennar abilities focus on pressure manipulation, bioluminescence, and aquatic superiority. Their pressure-damaged bodies provide unique tactical options.',
            backgroundSynergy: 'Drennar excel in backgrounds emphasizing survival, endurance, and trauma recovery. Their deformed bodies create interesting challenges on land.',
            classCompatibility: 'Drennar make excellent ambush specialists, pressure mages, and patient strategists. Their abilities enhance classes that rely on positioning and control.',
