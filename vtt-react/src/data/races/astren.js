        description: 'Folk with eyes that reflect unfamiliar constellations. Skin shows patterns like star maps. Their touch leaves frost or heat depending on their origin. Bodies sometimes seem to flicker between states. They move with alien grace, sometimes appearing in places they were not moments before. Their presence makes reality feel thin.',

        overview: 'The Astren are people whose ancestors literally fell from the stars. Crashing to earth in meteors and comets. Through generations of carrying cosmic energy, their bloodlines have been marked by alien origins. Eyes that reflect unfamiliar constellations. Minds that fracture under cosmic truths. Bodies scarred by the fall. They are organized into crater-communities built around the impact sites where their ancestors landed. Settlements clustered where the void touches earth. The Astren do not choose to be alien. It is their heritage, passed down through bloodlines that remember the great fall.',
        culturalBackground: `Astren society is built on crater-communities organized around the impact sites where their ancestors fell. Settlements clustered where meteors scarred the earth. Each community traces its founding to ancestors who crashed to earth in comets and meteors. Traditions preserving the memory of the great fall. Their craters scar the wilderness like divine wounds. Occupants emerging from the smoke with eyes that reflect constellations never seen from this world. Community elders pass down the old ways. How to channel cosmic energy. How to read star patterns. How to navigate the alien knowledge that fractures mortal minds. They speak of the great fall. Of being cast out from realms where mathematics paint reality and time flows backward. Their minds fracture under the weight of cosmic truths. Seeing futures that have not happened. Remembering lives never lived. Community disputes settle through star-readings and the testimony of those who remember the void best. They bear the cold of the void in their bones. Touch leaving frost patterns that linger for days. Some Astren become wandering prophets. Speaking truths that sound like madness to those who hear them. Others hoard their cosmic knowledge. Becoming enigmatic advisors to kings and warlords. They are a people bound by star and void. Their cosmic knowledge unmatched but their minds forever fractured by truths that break mortal understanding.`,
        variantDiversity: 'The Astren are divided into three major crater bloodlines: The Void-Walkers come from the empty spaces between stars, the Sun-Bound carry the fire of dying suns, and the Star-Mapped embody the patterns written in the constellations.',
