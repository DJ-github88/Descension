        culturalBackground: `The Skinwalkers are shamans who broke ancient taboos and were cursed to wear beast forms. They can transform into predatory animals, but each transformation risks losing their human consciousness to the beast within. Their culture is one of isolation and struggle - they are feared and shunned by normal society, yet they possess incredible power. Some embrace their curse and become savage hunters, while others seek redemption and fight to maintain their humanity. Skinwalker communities are rare, often consisting of outcasts helping each other resist the beast's call.`,
