# Witch Doctor Class Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Witch Doctor is a voodoo practitioner who invokes powerful loa (voodoo gods) through the Voodoo Essence resource system. This guide explains the implementation and how it integrates with the existing codebase.

**Note**: The specialization "Shadow Priest" was chosen instead of "Death Caller" to avoid confusion with the existing "Deathcaller" class.

## File Structure

### Main Data File
- **Location**: `vtt-react/src/data/classes/witchDoctorData.js`

### Integration Points
1. **RulesPage.jsx**: Added Witch Doctor to CLASS_DATA_MAP

- Apply poisons to weapons
- Identify which loa will be most valuable
- Place totems strategically

### Mid Combat (Rounds 4-6)
- Should have 6-10 essence
- Consider invoking Simbi for healing or Papa Legba for utility
- Continue building toward major invocations
- Maintain curse coverage on priority targets

### Late Combat (Rounds 7+)
- Prime time for Baron Samedi or Ogoun invocations
- Game-changing abilities can turn the tide
- Use accumulated essence for maximum impact

### Precursor Management
**Baron Samedi Preparation**:
- Curse multiple enemies early

## Integration with Existing Systems

### ClassDetailDisplay Component
Enhanced to support:
- essenceGenerationTable (Voodoo Essence generation methods)
- loaInvocationTable (Loa invocation costs and precursors)
- Standard passive ability format
- Specialization-specific passive abilities

### Spell Wizard Compatibility
All spells use the standard spell wizard format with:
- typeConfig, targetingConfig, durationConfig
- resourceCost (including new voodooEssence field)
- resolution, damageConfig, healingConfig, etc.
- effects object for detailed mechanics
- specialMechanics for class-specific features (essence generation, precursors, invocations)

## Roleplay Identity

### Philosophy
The loa are neither good nor evilâ€”they are forces of nature, ancient spirits with their own agendas. To invoke them is to make a pact, to offer respect and tribute in exchange for their devastating power.

### Common Archetypes
1. **The Tribal Shaman**: Keeper of ancestral traditions, protector of their people
2. **The Desperate Bargainer**: Made a pact with the loa in a moment of need
3. **The Dark Scholar**: Studied forbidden voodoo texts for power
4. **The Cursed Bloodline**: Born with the loa's mark, destined to serve

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Resource Tracking
- Voodoo Essence: 0-15 capacity
- Precursor conditions: Boolean flags tracked per loa
- Ritual completion: Tracked separately for Papa Legba precursor
- Curse count: Tracked for Baron Samedi precursor
- Ally positioning: Real-time checks for Erzulie/Ogoun

### Specialization Discounts
Implemented through specialMechanics in spell data:
```javascript
specialMechanics: {
  voodooEssence: {
    cost: 10,
    specialization_discount: 2,
    description: 'Death Callers pay only 8 essence'
  }
}
```

### Cooldown System
All loa invocations have "once per long rest" cooldown to prevent spam and maintain their ultimate ability status.

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
1. Additional totems (protection, damage, mana regeneration)
2. More curse varieties (silence, blindness, decay)
3. Ritual variations for different situations
4. Lesser loa invocations (lower cost, less powerful)
5. Voodoo doll mechanics for targeted curse amplification
6. Spirit animal companions
7. Ancestral spirit summoning
