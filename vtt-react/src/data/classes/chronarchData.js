    quickOverview: {
      title: 'Quick Overview',
      content: `**What You Need to Know**: The Chronarch manipulates time through two resources: Time Shards (generated by casting any spell, max 10) and Temporal Strain (accumulated when using Temporal Flux abilities, max 10). You spend Time Shards to activate powerful time-manipulation abilities (freeze enemies, rewind damage, teleport allies), but each use adds Temporal Strain. Reach 10 Strain and you suffer Temporal Backlash—losing your next turn and taking damage.

**Core Mechanic**: Cast spells → Generate Time Shards → Spend Shards on Temporal Flux abilities → Manage Temporal Strain → Avoid Backlash

**Resources**: Time Shards (0-10, persistent) & Temporal Strain (0-10, decays naturally)

**Playstyle**: Control specialist, support capabilities, high skill ceiling, resource balancing

**Best For**: Players who enjoy tactical timing, resource management, and controlling the battlefield`
    },

    description: `The Chronarch is a master of temporal magic, wielding the power to manipulate time itself. Through careful management of Time Shards and Temporal Strain, they can freeze enemies in stasis, rewind damage, and reposition allies across the battlefield. Every spell they cast generates temporal energy, which can be spent on powerful Temporal Flux abilities—but each use risks accumulating dangerous Temporal Strain.`,

    roleplayIdentity: {
      title: 'Roleplay Identity',
      content: `Chronarchs are scholars and mystics who have unlocked the secrets of temporal manipulation. They carry timepieces—ornate hourglasses, ancient pocket watches, crystalline sundials—as their arcane foci, each one a conduit for channeling time magic.

Their connection to the timestream manifests physically: eyes that shimmer with glimpses of possible futures, hair that ages and de-ages in flowing patterns, and temporal echoes that trail their movements like afterimages. At high Temporal Strain, reality around them begins to fracture, showing overlapping moments from past and future.

Common Chronarch archetypes include:
- **The Eternal Student**: Seeks to extend their lifespan to learn all knowledge across time
- **The Time-Lost Wanderer**: Displaced from their original timeline, searching for a way home
- **The Temporal Guardian**: Protects the timeline from those who would abuse time magic
- **The Paradox Seeker**: Obsessed with creating and resolving temporal paradoxes
- **The Regretful Mage**: Haunted by a past they desperately wish to change

Chronarchs often struggle with the burden of foresight—seeing multiple possible futures can make even simple decisions agonizing. They must resist the temptation to constantly rewind mistakes, knowing that overuse of their power leads to temporal instability.`
    },

    combatRole: {
      title: 'Combat Role',
      content: `The Chronarch is a control specialist with strong support capabilities. They excel at:

**Battlefield Control**: Freezing enemies in time, preventing actions, and manipulating turn order
**Damage Mitigation**: Rewinding damage taken by allies, creating temporal barriers
**Tactical Repositioning**: Teleporting allies and enemies, creating temporal clones
**Emergency Support**: Undoing catastrophic damage through time reversal

The Chronarch's power comes from managing two interconnected resources:
- **Time Shards**: Generated by casting spells, spent on Temporal Flux abilities
- **Temporal Strain**: Accumulated when using Flux abilities, risks Temporal Backlash at maximum

This dual-resource system creates a high-skill-ceiling playstyle where careful planning and resource management are essential. A skilled Chronarch can turn the tide of battle by perfectly timing their interventions, while a reckless one may suffer Temporal Backlash and lose control entirely.`
    },

    playstyle: {
      title: 'Playstyle & Strategy',
      content: `Playing a Chronarch is about strategic resource management and perfect timing. Key considerations:

**Time Shard Generation**:
- Every spell cast generates 1 Time Shard
- Maximum capacity: 10 Time Shards
- Spend shards on powerful Temporal Flux abilities
- Different specs generate shards at different rates

**Temporal Strain Management**:
- Each Temporal Flux ability adds Strain (1-5 points)
- Strain naturally decreases by 1 per turn if no Flux abilities are used
- At 10 Strain, you suffer Temporal Backlash (lose next turn, take damage)
- Balance power usage with recovery time

**Strategic Timing**:
- **Low Strain (0-3)**: Safe to use Flux abilities freely
- **Mid Strain (4-6)**: Moderate risk, plan your next moves carefully
- **High Strain (7-9)**: Dangerous territory, consider letting Strain decay
- **Critical Strain (10)**: Temporal Backlash triggers, avoid at all costs

**Specialization Synergies**:
- **Arc of Stasis**: Control-focused, freezing enemies and preventing actions
- **Arc of Displacement**: Mobility-focused, repositioning and teleportation
- **Arc of Rewinding**: Support-focused, healing and damage reversal

**Team Dynamics**:
- Protect allies by rewinding damage or freezing threats
- Enable aggressive plays by providing temporal safety nets
- Coordinate with team to maximize the value of time manipulation
- Communicate Strain levels to avoid unexpected Backlash`

    immersiveCombatExample: {
      title: 'Immersive Combat Example',
      content: `The battle rages around you as the barbarian charges your squishy wizard ally. With perfect timing, you cast Temporal Rewind as a Reaction, spending no Time Shards but generating one for later use. The barbarian's axe blow connects, but you rewind the damage, healing your ally and preventing the knockout.

Two turns later, with 3 Time Shards stored, you unleash Temporal Flux: Freeze, spending 3 Shards and gaining 2 Strain to lock the barbarian in temporal stasis for 2 rounds. Your Temporal Strain rises to 2, but the threat is neutralized.

Later in the fight, as the cleric falls to a critical hit, you spend 8 Time Shards on Temporal Flux: Resurrection, gaining 5 Strain and bringing them back to full health. Your Strain hits 7, so you carefully manage your remaining actions, letting Strain naturally decay over the next few turns while your team capitalizes on the momentum shift.

In the final moments, with Strain at 4, you spend your last 4 Shards on Temporal Flux: Phase Army, gaining 2 Strain to phase your entire party through an incoming fireball, emerging unharmed to deliver the finishing blow.`

    specializations: {
      title: 'Chronarch Specializations',
      content: `**Arc of Stasis**: Masters of temporal control, these Chronarchs excel at freezing enemies and manipulating battlefield positioning. Their spells generate fewer Time Shards but their Flux abilities are more efficient, causing less Strain.

**Arc of Displacement**: Mobility specialists who teleport allies and enemies with precision. They generate standard Time Shards but their Flux abilities have lower Strain costs and can affect larger groups.

**Arc of Rewinding**: Support-focused Chronarchs who specialize in healing and damage reversal. They generate more Time Shards from their spells and have powerful restorative Flux abilities, though with higher Strain costs.`

    resourceSystem: {
      title: 'Resource Management',
      content: `**Time Shards**: Your primary resource, generated by casting spells (typically 1 per spell). Maximum 10 Shards. Spent on Temporal Flux abilities for powerful effects.

**Temporal Strain**: Your risk resource, gained when using Temporal Flux abilities (1-8 Strain per use). Maximum 10 Strain. Naturally decays by 1 per turn when not using Flux abilities. At 10 Strain, suffer Temporal Backlash.

**Backlash Mechanics**: When you reach 10 Temporal Strain, you suffer Temporal Backlash:
- Lose your next turn completely
- Take 4d6 force damage
- All Temporal Strain is reset to 0
- Cannot use any abilities during the lost turn

**Resource Strategy**: Balance generating Shards with spending them wisely. High Strain means high risk of Backlash, so time your powerful abilities carefully. Use support spells to generate Shards while keeping Strain low.`

    advancedTips: {
      title: 'Advanced Tactics',
      content: `**Strain Banking**: Save Shards during low-threat rounds to unleash devastating combinations when enemies overextend.

**Turn Order Manipulation**: Use Temporal Acceleration strategically to ensure your team's damage dealers act before key enemy abilities trigger.

**Predictive Defense**: Freeze enemies you know will take powerful actions next turn, preventing them from using abilities that could threaten your team.

**Emergency Rewind**: Keep 4-6 Shards banked for emergency resurrection or massive area healing when the fight turns against you.

**Strain Decay Timing**: Let Strain decay naturally during enemy turns or when repositioning, maximizing your safe windows for Flux usage.`
