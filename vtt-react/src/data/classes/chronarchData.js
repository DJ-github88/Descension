    quickOverview: {
      title: 'Quick Overview',
      content: `**What You Need to Know**: The Chronarch manipulates time through two resources: Time Shards (generated by casting any spell, max 10) and Temporal Strain (accumulated when using Temporal Flux abilities, max 10). You spend Time Shards to activate powerful time-manipulation abilities (freeze enemies, rewind damage, teleport allies), but each use adds Temporal Strain. Reach 10 Strain and you suffer Temporal Backlash—losing your next turn and taking damage.

**Core Mechanic**: Cast spells → Generate Time Shards → Spend Shards on Temporal Flux abilities → Manage Temporal Strain → Avoid Backlash

**Resources**: Time Shards (0-10, persistent) & Temporal Strain (0-10, decays naturally)

**Playstyle**: Control specialist, support capabilities, high skill ceiling, resource balancing

**Best For**: Players who enjoy tactical timing, resource management, and controlling the battlefield`
    },

    description: `The Chronarch is a master of temporal magic, wielding the power to manipulate time itself. Through careful management of Time Shards and Temporal Strain, they can freeze enemies in stasis, rewind damage, and reposition allies across the battlefield. Every spell they cast generates temporal energy, which can be spent on powerful Temporal Flux abilities—but each use risks accumulating dangerous Temporal Strain.`,

    roleplayIdentity: {
      title: 'Roleplay Identity',
      content: `Chronarchs are scholars and mystics who have unlocked the secrets of temporal manipulation. They carry timepieces—ornate hourglasses, ancient pocket watches, crystalline sundials—as their arcane foci, each one a conduit for channeling time magic.

Their connection to the timestream manifests physically: eyes that shimmer with glimpses of possible futures, hair that ages and de-ages in flowing patterns, and temporal echoes that trail their movements like afterimages. At high Temporal Strain, reality around them begins to fracture, showing overlapping moments from past and future.

Common Chronarch archetypes include:
- **The Eternal Student**: Seeks to extend their lifespan to learn all knowledge across time
- **The Time-Lost Wanderer**: Displaced from their original timeline, searching for a way home
- **The Temporal Guardian**: Protects the timeline from those who would abuse time magic
- **The Paradox Seeker**: Obsessed with creating and resolving temporal paradoxes
- **The Regretful Mage**: Haunted by a past they desperately wish to change

Chronarchs often struggle with the burden of foresight—seeing multiple possible futures can make even simple decisions agonizing. They must resist the temptation to constantly rewind mistakes, knowing that overuse of their power leads to temporal instability.`

    combatRole: {
      title: 'Combat Role',
      content: `The Chronarch is a control specialist with strong support capabilities. They excel at:

**Battlefield Control**: Freezing enemies in time, preventing actions, and manipulating turn order
**Damage Mitigation**: Rewinding damage taken by allies, creating temporal barriers
**Tactical Repositioning**: Teleporting allies and enemies, creating temporal clones
**Emergency Support**: Undoing catastrophic damage through time reversal

The Chronarch's power comes from managing two interconnected resources:
- **Time Shards**: Generated by casting spells, spent on Temporal Flux abilities
- **Temporal Strain**: Accumulated when using Flux abilities, risks Temporal Backlash at maximum

This dual-resource system creates a high-skill-ceiling playstyle where careful planning and resource management are essential. A skilled Chronarch can turn the tide of battle by perfectly timing their interventions, while a reckless one may suffer Temporal Backlash and lose control entirely.`
    },

    playstyle: {
      title: 'Playstyle & Strategy',
      content: `Playing a Chronarch is about strategic resource management and perfect timing. Key considerations:

**Time Shard Generation**:
- Every spell cast generates 1 Time Shard
- Maximum capacity: 10 Time Shards
- Spend shards on powerful Temporal Flux abilities
- Different specs generate shards at different rates

**Temporal Strain Management**:
- Each Temporal Flux ability adds Strain (1-5 points)
- Strain naturally decreases by 1 per turn if no Flux abilities are used
- At 10 Strain, you suffer Temporal Backlash (lose next turn, take damage)
- Balance power usage with recovery time

**Strategic Timing**:
- **Low Strain (0-3)**: Safe to use Flux abilities freely
- **Mid Strain (4-6)**: Moderate risk, plan your next moves carefully
- **High Strain (7-9)**: Dangerous territory, consider letting Strain decay
- **Critical Strain (10)**: Temporal Backlash triggers, avoid at all costs

**Specialization Synergies**:
- **Arc of Stasis**: Control-focused, freezing enemies and preventing actions
- **Arc of Displacement**: Mobility-focused, repositioning and teleportation
- **Arc of Rewinding**: Support-focused, healing and damage reversal

**Team Dynamics**:
- Protect allies by rewinding damage or freezing threats
- Enable aggressive plays by providing temporal safety nets
- Coordinate with team to maximize the value of time manipulation
- Communicate Strain levels to avoid unexpected Backlash`

    immersiveCombatExample: {
      title: 'Combat Example: Rewinding Disaster',
      content: `**The Setup**: Your party is fighting a powerful lich and two skeletal champions. Your tank just took a massive hit (35 damage, down to 10 HP). The lich is channeling a death spell that will finish him next turn. You're a Chronarch with 6 Time Shards and 2 Temporal Strain.

**Starting State**: Time Shards: 6 | Temporal Strain: 2 | Mana: 40/50

**Turn 1 - The Rewind (Shards: 6 → 3, Strain: 2 → 5)**

*Your tank falls to one knee, blood pouring from a grievous wound. The lich's skeletal hand glows with necrotic energy. You see the future—in three seconds, your tank dies. Unacceptable.*

**Your Decision**: Use "Temporal Rewind" (Costs 3 Time Shards, adds 3 Temporal Strain)
**Time Shards**: 6 - 3 = 3 remaining
**Temporal Strain**: 2 + 3 = 5

*You raise your hand, and your ornate hourglass glows with silver light. Time STUTTERS. The world flickers. Suddenly, your tank's wounds close—not through healing, but through time reversing. The blood flows backward into his body. The wound seals. He's back at 45 HP, as if the hit never happened.*

**Effect**: Tank's HP restored from 10 → 45 (rewound 35 damage)

**Your Tank**: "What... what just happened?"
**You**: "You died. I fixed it. You're welcome."

*But you feel the strain. Reality around you ripples. Your Temporal Strain is at 5—halfway to Backlash.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Chrono Bolt" (basic time spell, 5 mana) at lich
**Time Shards**: +1 (now at 4) - every spell generates a shard!
**Damage**: 2d8 → [6, 7] = 13 damage

**Turn 2 - Freezing the Threat (Shards: 4 → 1, Strain: 5 → 8)**

*The lich continues channeling. You can see the spell forming—a death ray that will kill your tank in one hit, even at full HP. You need to stop it.*

**Your Decision**: Use "Temporal Stasis" (Costs 3 Time Shards, adds 3 Temporal Strain)
**Time Shards**: 4 - 3 = 1 remaining
**Temporal Strain**: 5 + 3 = 8 (DANGER ZONE!)

*You focus on the lich, and time around it STOPS. The lich freezes mid-cast, suspended in a bubble of frozen time. Its death spell hangs incomplete, crackling with unreleased energy.*

**Effect**: Lich is frozen for 2 turns, cannot act, death spell interrupted

*But the cost is severe. Your vision blurs. You see multiple timelines overlapping—past, present, future all at once. Your Temporal Strain is at 8. Two more points and you'll suffer Temporal Backlash.*

**Your Healer**: "Are you okay? You're... flickering."
**You**: "I'm fine. Just... holding time together. No big deal."

**Your Action**: Cast "Temporal Bolt" (basic spell, 5 mana) at skeletal champion
**Time Shards**: +1 (now at 2)
**Damage**: 2d6 → [5, 4] = 9 damage

**Turn 3 - Letting Strain Decay (Shards: 2 → 3, Strain: 8 → 7)**

*The lich is frozen. The skeletal champions are manageable. You need to let your Temporal Strain decay before you risk Backlash.*

**Your Decision**: DO NOT use any Temporal Flux abilities this turn
**Temporal Strain**: 8 - 1 = 7 (natural decay)

*You take a breath. The overlapping timelines stabilize. Reality solidifies around you. The strain is easing.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Chrono Missile" (basic spell, 6 mana) at skeletal champion
**Time Shards**: +1 (now at 3)
**Damage**: 3d6 → [4, 5, 6] = 15 damage
**Result**: Skeletal champion destroyed

**Turn 4 - The Lich Unfreezes (Shards: 3 → 4, Strain: 7 → 6)**

*The temporal stasis around the lich shatters. Time resumes. The lich is furious.*

**Lich's Turn**: Casts "Finger of Death" at your healer → 45 damage!
**Your Healer**: Down to 5 HP, critical condition

*Your healer is dying. You have 3 Time Shards and 7 Temporal Strain. You could rewind the damage (costs 3 shards, adds 3 strain), but that would put you at 10 Strain—instant Backlash.*

**Your Decision**: DO NOT rewind. Let the healer survive with 5 HP. Avoid Backlash.
**Temporal Strain**: 7 - 1 = 6 (natural decay from not using Flux)

*It's agonizing. You COULD save your healer. But if you do, you'll lose your next turn to Backlash, and the lich will kill everyone. Sometimes the hardest choice is doing nothing.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Temporal Acceleration" (basic spell, 7 mana) on your tank
**Time Shards**: +1 (now at 4)
**Effect**: Tank gets an extra action this turn

**Your Tank**: Uses extra action to attack lich → 25 damage

**Turn 5 - The Calculated Risk (Shards: 4 → 2, Strain: 6 → 8)**

*The lich is at 40% HP. One more big push could end this. You have 4 Time Shards and 6 Temporal Strain. You could use "Temporal Displacement" to teleport the lich into your party's melee range (costs 2 shards, adds 2 strain). That would put you at 8 Strain—risky, but not Backlash.*

**Your Decision**: Use "Temporal Displacement" (Costs 2 Time Shards, adds 2 Temporal Strain)
**Time Shards**: 4 - 2 = 2 remaining
**Temporal Strain**: 6 + 2 = 8

*You tear a hole in space-time. The lich BLINKS out of existence and reappears 30 feet away—right in front of your tank and rogue.*

**Effect**: Lich teleported into melee range

**Your Tank & Rogue**: Both attack with advantage (lich is disoriented) → Combined 40 damage
**Result**: Lich destroyed!

*The battle is over. Your Temporal Strain slowly decays (8 → 7 → 6...). You collapse, exhausted.*

**Your Party**: "You saved us. Again."
**You**: "I just... moved some time around. It's what I do."

*But you know the truth. You were two Strain points away from Temporal Backlash. Two points away from losing control and dooming everyone. That's the Chronarch's burden—wielding godlike power over time, but always one mistake away from catastrophe.*

**The Lesson**: Chronarch gameplay is about calculated risks. You have the power to rewind death, freeze enemies, and manipulate the battlefield—but every use of that power pushes you closer to Backlash. Sometimes the right play is NOT using your power. Sometimes you let an ally take damage to avoid Strain. Sometimes you let Strain decay instead of acting. Master Chronarchs know when to intervene and when to wait. Time is patient. So must you be.`

  // Resource System
  resourceSystem: {
    title: 'Temporal Mastery',
    subtitle: 'Time Shards & Temporal Strain',

    description: `The Chronarch's power stems from two interconnected resources: Time Shards, which represent accumulated temporal energy, and Temporal Strain, which represents the instability caused by manipulating time. Mastering the balance between these resources is the key to becoming a powerful Chronarch. Unlike most classes with a single resource, you're managing a generation resource (Time Shards) and a risk resource (Temporal Strain) simultaneously.`,

    resourceBarExplanation: {
      title: 'Understanding Your Resource Bars',
      content: `**Time Shards Bar (Top - Blue/Silver)**:

**What You See**: A horizontal bar with 10 crystalline shard icons, each representing one Time Shard. As you cast spells, shards materialize one by one, glowing with silver-blue temporal energy. The shards pulse gently, showing the flow of time.

**Visual Representation**:
- **Empty Shards**: Transparent crystal outlines, waiting to be filled
- **Filled Shards**: Glowing silver-blue crystals, pulsing with temporal energy
- **Spending Shards**: When you use a Temporal Flux ability, shards shatter into particles of light and flow into the spell

**How It Changes**:
- **When You Cast Any Spell**: +1 shard materializes (smooth crystallization animation)
- **When You Use Temporal Flux**: Shards shatter and flow into the ability (dramatic breaking effect)
- **Between Combats**: Shards persist (they don't decay)

**Temporal Strain Bar (Bottom - Orange/Red)**:

**What You See**: A horizontal bar with 10 segments that fill with increasingly intense colors as Strain accumulates. Unlike Time Shards (which you want to build), Temporal Strain is a DANGER meter—the higher it climbs, the closer you are to catastrophe.

**Visual Representation by Strain Level**:
- **0-2 Strain**: Empty/dim, safe green glow
- **3-4 Strain**: Light yellow, slight warning
- **5-6 Strain**: Orange, moderate danger, bar pulses slowly
- **7-8 Strain**: Deep orange-red, high danger, bar pulses rapidly
- **9 Strain**: Bright red, critical danger, bar flashes with warning
- **10 Strain**: TEMPORAL BACKLASH - Bar explodes, screen shakes, reality fractures

**How It Changes**:
- **When You Use Temporal Flux**: Segments fill based on ability cost (1-5 segments)
- **End of Turn (No Flux Used)**: -1 segment empties (natural decay, calming animation)
- **Temporal Backlash (10 Strain)**: Bar explodes, you lose next turn, take damage, Strain resets to 0

**The Backlash Warning**: When you're at 7+ Strain, your character model shows visual effects:
- Temporal echoes trail your movements
- Reality flickers around you
- Your hourglass/timepiece cracks and glows dangerously
- Screen edges shimmer with temporal distortion

**Why This Matters**:

You're managing TWO opposing resources:
- **Time Shards** = Power (you want MORE)
- **Temporal Strain** = Risk (you want LESS)

Every Temporal Flux ability costs Time Shards (reducing power) and adds Temporal Strain (increasing risk). This creates a constant tension: Do you spend your shards now (risking Strain) or wait for Strain to decay (losing tempo)?

**The Chronarch's Paradox**:
- High Shards + Low Strain = Maximum power, safe to act
- High Shards + High Strain = Maximum power, dangerous to act
- Low Shards + Low Strain = Building phase, safe but weak
- Low Shards + High Strain = Worst state, weak AND dangerous

**Strategic Depth**: Unlike a Berserker who just watches one Rage bar climb, you're balancing two bars that move in opposite directions. Your Time Shards climb naturally (every spell), but your Temporal Strain only decays when you DON'T use Flux abilities. This creates a rhythm: Build shards → Spend on Flux → Let Strain decay → Repeat. Break this rhythm and you risk Backlash.`
    },

    mechanics: {
      title: 'Detailed Mechanics',
      content: `**Time Shards (Power Resource)**

**Maximum Capacity**: 10 Time Shards

**Generation (Automatic)**:
- **Every Spell Cast**: +1 Time Shard (regardless of spell type or mana cost)
  - Example: Cast "Chrono Bolt" (5 mana) → +1 Time Shard
  - Example: Cast "Temporal Acceleration" (7 mana) → +1 Time Shard
  - Example: Cast "Time Stop" (15 mana) → +1 Time Shard

**Persistence**: Time Shards persist between combats until spent or until you complete a long rest
- Example: End combat with 7 Time Shards → Start next combat with 7 Time Shards

**Usage (Spending on Temporal Flux Abilities)**:
- **Basic Flux Abilities**: Cost 1-2 Time Shards
- **Moderate Flux Abilities**: Cost 3-4 Time Shards
- **Powerful Flux Abilities**: Cost 5-6 Time Shards
- **Ultimate Flux Abilities**: Cost 7-10 Time Shards

**Temporal Strain (Risk Resource)**

**Maximum Capacity**: 10 Temporal Strain (reaching 10 triggers Backlash)

**Starting State**: Begin each combat at 0 Temporal Strain (resets between fights)

**Accumulation (When Using Temporal Flux Abilities)**:
- **Minor Flux Abilities**: +1 Temporal Strain
  - Example: "Time Warp" (speed boost) → +1 Strain
- **Moderate Flux Abilities**: +2-3 Temporal Strain
  - Example: "Temporal Rewind" (undo damage) → +3 Strain
- **Major Flux Abilities**: +4-5 Temporal Strain
  - Example: "Eternal Stasis" (freeze enemy indefinitely) → +5 Strain

**Natural Decay (Passive Recovery)**:
- **End of Each Turn**: -1 Temporal Strain IF you didn't use any Temporal Flux abilities that turn
  - Example: Turn 1: Use Temporal Rewind (+3 Strain, now at 3)
  - Example: Turn 2: Cast normal spells only → End of turn: -1 Strain (now at 2)
  - Example: Turn 3: Cast normal spells only → End of turn: -1 Strain (now at 1)

**Temporal Backlash (Critical Failure at 10 Strain)**:
- **Trigger**: Temporal Strain reaches 10
- **Effect**:
  - Lose your next turn (you're frozen in time, unable to act)
  - Take damage equal to your Temporal Strain before Backlash (10 damage)
  - Temporal Strain resets to 0
  - All active temporal effects you created end immediately
- **Narrative**: Reality rebels against your manipulation. Time fractures around you, and you're caught in the backlash.

**Example Backlash Scenario**:
- You're at 8 Temporal Strain
- You use "Temporal Displacement" (+2 Strain)
- Strain reaches 10 → BACKLASH!
- You lose your next turn
- You take 10 damage
- Strain resets to 0
- Any frozen enemies unfreeze, any temporal clones vanish

**Temporal Flux Abilities (The Core Mechanic)**:

These are special abilities that:
1. Cost Time Shards to activate
2. Add Temporal Strain when used
3. Directly manipulate time (freeze, rewind, teleport, clone, etc.)

**Example Flux Abilities**:
- **Temporal Rewind** (3 Shards, +3 Strain): Undo damage taken by an ally in the last turn
- **Time Freeze** (4 Shards, +4 Strain): Freeze an enemy for 2 turns
- **Temporal Clone** (5 Shards, +3 Strain): Create a copy of yourself that lasts 3 turns
- **Eternal Stasis** (6 Shards, +5 Strain): Freeze an enemy indefinitely until you release them

**Strategic Balance**:
The key to mastering the Chronarch is knowing when to spend your Time Shards. Using powerful Flux abilities can turn the tide of battle, but accumulating too much Strain can leave you vulnerable. Sometimes the best play is to let your Strain decay naturally before unleashing your next temporal assault.

**The Rhythm of Time**:
- **Turns 1-2**: Cast spells, build Time Shards (0 → 2 shards)
- **Turn 3**: Use Temporal Flux ability (spend 3 shards, gain 3 Strain)
- **Turns 4-5**: Cast spells, let Strain decay (3 → 2 → 1 Strain)
- **Turn 6**: Use another Temporal Flux ability
- **Repeat**: Build, spend, decay, repeat`

    strategicConsiderations: {
      title: 'Strategic Considerations',
      content: `**Shard Generation Rate**:
Your spell rotation determines how quickly you build Time Shards. Faster-casting spells generate shards more quickly but may be less efficient. Balance shard generation with combat effectiveness.

**Strain Management Techniques**:
- **Burst Windows**: Build to 8-9 shards, use multiple Flux abilities in succession, then let Strain decay
- **Sustained Control**: Use low-Strain abilities (1-2 Strain) regularly while maintaining safe Strain levels
- **Emergency Reserve**: Keep 3-5 shards available for critical Reverse Time or Time Freeze moments
- **Time Sacrifice**: Use this ability to reduce Strain in emergencies, but beware the health cost

**Specialization Differences**:
- **Arc of Stasis**: Focuses on high-Strain control abilities, requires careful Strain management
- **Arc of Displacement**: Uses moderate-Strain mobility abilities, more forgiving resource curve
- **Arc of Rewinding**: Emphasizes low-Strain support abilities, can maintain sustained Flux usage

**Team Coordination**:
Communicate your Time Shard count and Strain level to your team. They need to know when you can provide emergency support (Reverse Time) or when you're at risk of Backlash and need protection.`
    },

    practicalExample: {
      title: 'Practical Decision-Making Example',
      content: `**Scenario**: Boss fight, Turn 5. You have 7 Time Shards and 6 Temporal Strain. The boss just dealt 40 damage to your rogue (now at 5 HP, critical). Your tank is at 50% HP. Boss has 35% HP remaining.

**Current State**:
- Time Shards: 7
- Temporal Strain: 6 (Moderate Risk - approaching danger zone)
- Rogue HP: 5/45 (critical, will die to any hit)
- Tank HP: 60/120 (stable)
- Boss HP: ~35%

**Option A - Temporal Rewind (Save the Rogue)**:
Use "Temporal Rewind" to undo the 40 damage to rogue
- Cost: 3 Time Shards, +3 Temporal Strain
- Result: Rogue back to 45 HP, you have 4 Shards and 9 Strain
- Pros: Rogue survives, can continue dealing damage
- Cons: You're at 9 Strain (one point from Backlash), very dangerous
- Risk: If you need to use ANY Flux ability next turn, you Backlash

**Option B - Let Rogue Stay Low, Focus on Boss**:
Cast normal spell at boss, let Strain decay
- Cost: 0 Time Shards, -1 Temporal Strain (natural decay)
- Result: Rogue stays at 5 HP, you have 7 Shards and 5 Strain
- Pros: Strain decreases to safer level, you deal damage to boss
- Cons: Rogue might die to boss's next attack
- Risk: Rogue death vs. your Strain safety

**Option C - Time Freeze the Boss**:
Use "Time Freeze" to freeze boss for 1 turn, giving healer time to save rogue
- Cost: 5 Time Shards, +4 Temporal Strain
- Result: Boss frozen, you have 2 Shards and 10 Strain → BACKLASH!
- Pros: Boss can't attack rogue, healer can heal
- Cons: You immediately Backlash (lose next turn, take 10 damage, Strain resets)
- Risk: Guaranteed Backlash, you're out of commission for a turn

**Option D - Time Sacrifice + Temporal Rewind**:
Use "Time Sacrifice" to reduce Strain, then use Temporal Rewind
- Cost: Take 2d6 necrotic damage, reduce Strain by 3, then spend 3 Shards and add 3 Strain
- Result: You take ~7 damage, Strain goes 6 → 3 → 6, Shards go 7 → 4, rogue healed
- Pros: Rogue saved, Strain stays at 6 (manageable)
- Cons: You take damage, complex two-ability combo
- Risk: Moderate, but you're using health as a resource

**Best Choice**: Option D (Time Sacrifice + Temporal Rewind)

**Why**:
1. **Rogue Survival**: Rogue at 5 HP will die to boss's next attack (boss deals ~30 damage per hit)
2. **Strain Management**: Time Sacrifice reduces Strain by 3, offsetting the +3 from Temporal Rewind
3. **Resource Efficiency**: You end with 4 Shards and 6 Strain—still functional
4. **Avoiding Backlash**: Option C causes immediate Backlash, Option A puts you one point away
5. **Health Trade**: You take ~7 damage, but you're at full HP and can afford it

**Execution**:
- Use "Time Sacrifice" → Take 2d6 → [3, 4] = 7 necrotic damage
- Temporal Strain: 6 - 3 = 3
- Use "Temporal Rewind" on rogue → Spend 3 Time Shards, +3 Temporal Strain
- Time Shards: 7 - 3 = 4
- Temporal Strain: 3 + 3 = 6
- Rogue HP: 5 → 45 (damage rewound)

**Result**: Rogue saved, you have 4 Shards and 6 Strain (moderate risk, manageable), you took 7 damage but you're still healthy.

**Next Turn Strategy**:
- Cast normal spells only (no Flux abilities)
- Temporal Strain decays: 6 → 5
- Build Time Shards back up: 4 → 5 → 6
- Once Strain is at 3-4, you can safely use Flux abilities again

**Alternative if Boss Was at 10% HP**: Option B (Let rogue stay low, kill boss)
- Why: If boss is almost dead, better to finish the fight than save the rogue. Dead boss = no more damage to anyone.

**The Lesson**: Chronarch decision-making involves:
1. **Strain Awareness**: Always know how close you are to Backlash (10 Strain)
2. **Resource Trading**: Time Sacrifice lets you trade health for Strain reduction
3. **Triage**: Sometimes you let an ally stay low to avoid Backlash
4. **Combo Thinking**: Time Sacrifice + Temporal Rewind is a powerful combo for high-Strain situations
5. **Future Planning**: Consider not just this turn, but next turn's Strain decay

You're not just managing resources—you're managing TIME ITSELF. Every decision ripples forward. Plan accordingly.`
