    description: `The Fate Weaver manipulates the threads of destiny using their unique connection to cosmic forces. They draw power from cards, utilizing "Threads of Destiny" to influence the outcomes of their spells and actions. This mechanic allows Fate Weavers to predict, alter, and control the course of events in battle, making their actions as strategic as they are mystical.`,

      content: `Fate Weavers are individuals who have learned to see and manipulate the invisible threads that connect all events. They understand that destiny is not fixed but malleable—a tapestry that can be rewoven by those with the knowledge and power to do so. Through their mystical deck of cards, they read the future, alter the present, and learn from the past.

**The Fate Weaver's Philosophy**: Destiny is not predetermined—it is a game of cards where skill, strategy, and a touch of luck determine the outcome. Every draw is an opportunity, every failure a lesson, and every thread a tool for reshaping reality.

**Common Archetypes**:
- **The Oracle**: A mystic who reads the cards to divine the future and guide allies toward favorable outcomes
- **The Card Sharp**: A cunning strategist who treats fate like a game, always holding the right card at the right time
- **The Thread Spinner**: A weaver of destiny who collects failures and transforms them into power
- **The Fortune Teller**: A mysterious figure who sees patterns in chaos and turns misfortune into opportunity
- **The Deck Master**: A master of probability who stacks the deck in their favor through careful manipulation
- **The Cosmic Gambler**: A risk-taker who embraces both success and failure, knowing each feeds their power`,

      content: `Fate Weavers thrive in situations that require careful planning and foresight. Their card-based abilities provide a unique blend of chance and control, allowing them to adapt to changing circumstances and turn the tide of battle.

**Core Strategy**:
1. **Thread Management**: Balance between accepting failures to generate Threads and spending Threads to guarantee success
2. **Card Knowledge**: Understanding poker hands, blackjack values, and other card game mechanics
3. **Timing**: Knowing when to spend Threads to call specific cards vs. accepting random draws
4. **Failure Conversion**: Embracing negative outcomes as opportunities to build Thread reserves
5. **Deck Manipulation**: Using Threads strategically to ensure favorable draws when it matters most

**Thread Economy**:
- Generate 1 Thread when spells fail or have no effect
- Generate 1-2 Threads when spells have negative outcomes (severity-dependent)
- Spend 2 Threads to call a specific card from the deck (once per turn)
- Maximum Thread capacity: 13 Threads (13 cards per suit: Ace through King)

**Optimal Play Patterns**:
- Early combat: Accept some failures to build Thread reserves
- Mid combat: Use Threads to guarantee key spell successes
- Late combat: Spend remaining Threads for finishing moves
- Always maintain 4-6 Threads as emergency reserve`,

    immersiveCombatExample: {
      title: 'Combat Example: The Gambler\'s Paradox',
      content: `**The Setup**: You're a Fate Weaver (Fortune Teller specialization) facing a powerful necromancer and two skeletal guards. Your party needs you to deal damage, but your spells are card-based—unpredictable. Starting Threads: 4. Starting Mana: 45/50. Your goal: Use card mechanics strategically, build Threads from failures, then spend them to guarantee success when it matters.

**Starting State**: Threads: 4/13 | Mana: 45/50 | HP: 55/70 | Deck: Shuffled (52 cards)

**Turn 1 - The Risky Play (Threads: 4 → 5)**

*The necromancer raises his staff, dark energy crackling. The skeletal guards advance. You draw a card from your mystical deck. Time to see what fate has in store.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Hand of Fate" on Necromancer (8 mana, draw 5 cards for poker hand)
**Cards Drawn**: [3♠, 7♦, J♣, 2♥, 9♠]
**Poker Hand**: High Card (Jack) - WORST POSSIBLE HAND
**Damage**: 2d6 (base for High Card) → [4, 5] = 9 damage
**Thread Generation**: +1 Thread (spell succeeded but with minimal effect)

*The cards shimmer and fade. A weak bolt of energy strikes the necromancer. He barely flinches. But you feel it—a Thread of Destiny forming from the failure. The universe owes you one.*

**Threads**: 4 + 1 = **5 Threads**
**Mana**: 45 - 8 = 37/50

**Necromancer's Turn**: Casts "Bone Spear" at you → 3d8 → [6, 7, 5] = 18 damage
**Your HP**: 55 - 18 = 37/70

**Current State**: Threads: 5/13 | Mana: 37/50 | HP: 37/70

**Turn 2 - Building Threads (Threads: 5 → 8)**

*You're hurt, but you have a plan. You need more Threads. Time to take a risk.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Draw of the Damned" on Skeletal Guard #1 (6 mana, blackjack-style)
**Goal**: Get close to 21 for maximum damage, but don't bust

**Card 1**: [K♥] = 10 → Total: 10
**Decision**: Hit (draw another card)
**Card 2**: [8♣] = 8 → Total: 18
**Decision**: Hit (risky, but you want more damage)
**Card 3**: [9♦] = 9 → Total: 27 → **BUST!**

*The cards explode in your face. Dark energy backlashes, reducing your AC.*

**Result**: Bust (over 21) → AC reduced by 2 for 2 rounds, NO DAMAGE to target
**Thread Generation**: +2 Threads (major negative outcome)
**Threads**: 5 + 2 = **7 Threads**
**Mana**: 37 - 6 = 31/50

*Your party's tank groans. "Did you just... hurt yourself?" You smile through the pain. "I'm building resources. Trust me."*

**Skeletal Guard #1's Turn**: Attacks you (you have -2 AC!) → Hit! → 2d6+2 → [5, 4] + 2 = 11 damage
**Your HP**: 37 - 11 = 26/70

**Your Party's Healer**: Heals you for 15 HP
**Your HP**: 26 + 15 = 41/70

**Current State**: Threads: 7/13 | Mana: 31/50 | HP: 41/70 | AC: -2 (1 round remaining)

**Turn 3 - The Setup (Threads: 7 → 9)**

*You're at 7 Threads. Not quite enough to guarantee the perfect hand, but getting close. One more failure should do it.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Heart's Gamble" on Skeletal Guard #2 (5 mana, draw cards until non-heart)
**Goal**: Draw as few hearts as possible for maximum damage to enemy

**Card 1**: [4♥] → Heart! → Continue drawing
**Card 2**: [Q♥] → Heart (face card)! → Continue drawing
**Card 3**: [7♠] → Non-heart! → STOP

**Result**: Drew 2 hearts (one face card) → Take 2d6 damage yourself
**Damage to Self**: 2d6 → [5, 6] = 11 damage
**Damage to Enemy**: 0 (hearts cancel damage)
**Thread Generation**: +2 Threads (major negative outcome - face card heart + self-damage)

*The cards turn against you. Hearts burn your hands. You scream, but you're SMILING. Two more Threads. You're at 9 now.*

**Your HP**: 41 - 11 = 30/70
**Threads**: 7 + 2 = **9 Threads**
**Mana**: 31 - 5 = 26/50

**Your Party's Rogue**: "Are you TRYING to kill yourself?!"
**You**: "No. I'm trying to kill HIM." *You point at the necromancer.* "Next turn. Watch."

**Current State**: Threads: 9/13 | Mana: 26/50 | HP: 30/70

**Turn 4 - The Payoff (Threads: 9 → 1)**

*You're at 9 Threads. Enough to call 4 specific cards (2 Threads per card). Time to build a Royal Flush.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Hand of Fate" on Necromancer (8 mana, draw 5 cards)
**Thread Spending**: Spend 8 Threads to call 4 specific cards (2 Threads each)

**Called Cards**:
- Call [A♠] (2 Threads)
- Call [K♠] (2 Threads)
- Call [Q♠] (2 Threads)
- Call [J♠] (2 Threads)

**Random 5th Card**: [10♠] → **ROYAL FLUSH!**

*The cards appear in your hand, glowing with golden light. Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten—all spades. The BEST POSSIBLE HAND. The necromancer's eyes widen.*

**Poker Hand**: Royal Flush (best hand)
**Damage**: 10d10 (Royal Flush damage) → [9, 8, 10, 7, 9, 6, 10, 8, 9, 7] = **83 damage!**

*The cards explode into pure radiant energy, engulfing the necromancer. He screams as the light consumes him. When it fades, he's DEAD. Obliterated.*

**Threads**: 9 - 8 = **1 Thread**
**Mana**: 26 - 8 = 18/50

**Your Party**: *Stunned silence*
**Your Tank**: "...Okay, I take it back. That was worth it."
**You**: "Told you. Fate favors the patient."

**Skeletal Guards**: Without their master, the guards crumble to dust.

**Combat Over**

**The Lesson**: Fate Weaver gameplay is about:
1. **Thread Building**: Turns 1-3 generated 5 Threads (1 + 2 + 2) from failures and negative outcomes
2. **Accepting Failure**: Deliberately took risky plays (Draw of the Damned bust, Heart's Gamble) to build Threads
3. **Self-Damage Trade**: Took 11 damage from Heart's Gamble but gained 2 Threads—worth it for the setup
4. **Thread Spending**: Spent 8 Threads to call 4 specific cards, guaranteeing 4/5 of a Royal Flush
5. **Luck + Skill**: Random 5th card ([10♠]) completed the Royal Flush—but you stacked the odds
6. **Damage Variance**: Turn 1 dealt 9 damage (High Card), Turn 4 dealt 83 damage (Royal Flush) - 9x multiplier!
7. **Resource Conversion**: Converted 3 turns of failures/self-damage into 1 turn of massive burst

You're not a consistent damage dealer. You're a GAMBLER who turns bad luck into good luck. You take hits, you fail spells, you hurt yourself—all to build Threads. Then, when it matters, you spend those Threads to manipulate fate itself. You don't just draw cards. You CALL them. And when you call a Royal Flush, nothing survives.`

    title: 'Threads of Destiny',
    subtitle: 'Weaving Fate from Failure',

    description: `Threads of Destiny are the Fate Weaver's unique resource, generated whenever their spells fail or produce negative outcomes. These mystical threads represent the cosmic energy released when destiny is disrupted, which the Fate Weaver can then harness to manipulate future events. By spending Threads, Fate Weavers can call specific cards from their deck, transforming randomness into calculated strategy.`,

    resourceBarExplanation: {
      title: 'Understanding Your Threads of Destiny Gauge',
      content: `**What You See**: Your Threads of Destiny gauge displays as a horizontal bar with 13 segments, each representing 1 Thread (mirroring the 13 cards per suit: Ace through King). The bar is styled like a golden tapestry with intricate weaving patterns and card suit symbols (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣). As you accumulate Threads, the segments fill with shimmering golden-silver energy, representing the cosmic threads you've woven from fate's disruptions.

**Visual Representation by Thread Level**:

**0-3 Threads (Building Phase)**:
- Bar: 0-3 segments filled with dim golden glow
- Border: Gray (neutral)
- Effect: Minimal visual effects
- Status: "Building Threads"
- Recommendation: "Accept failures to build reserves"

**4-7 Threads (Moderate Reserve)**:
- Bar: 4-7 segments filled, golden glow brightening
- Border: Yellow (caution)
- Effect: Threads shimmer and pulse gently
- Status: "Moderate Reserve"
- Recommendation: "Spend on critical spells only"
- Call Card Button: Enabled (glowing) - "Call Specific Card (2 Threads)"

**8-12 Threads (Good Reserve)**:
- Bar: 8-12 segments filled, bright golden energy
- Border: Green (good)
- Effect: Threads weave together in animated patterns
- Status: "Good Reserve"
- Recommendation: "Spend freely on important moments"
- Call Card Button: Brightly glowing - "4-6 cards available"

**10-12 Threads (Destiny's Web)**:
- Bar: 10-12 segments filled, intense orange-gold glow
- Border: Orange-gold (high reserve)
- Effect: Threads pulse with power, weaving complex patterns
- Status: "Destiny's Web - Aggressive Manipulation"
- Recommendation: "Maximize control over fate"
- Call Card Button: Pulsing - "5-6 cards available"

**13 Threads (Fate Mastered - The King)**:
- Bar: All 13 segments filled, maximum brightness with crown symbol
- Border: Golden (warning - at cap)
- Effect: Threads overflow with energy, sparkling particles
- Status: "FATE MASTERED - The King's Power!"
- Recommendation: "Spend liberally to avoid waste"
- Warning Text: "Thread generation will be wasted if at 13!"

**Thread Generation Animation**:
When you gain Threads from a failure or negative outcome:
- **+1 Thread**: Single golden thread appears from the spell effect, flows to your bar, fills 1 segment
- **+2 Threads**: Two golden threads appear, intertwine, flow to bar, fill 2 segments with dramatic animation
- **Audio**: Soft chime sound for +1 Thread, louder chime for +2 Threads
- **Text Popup**: "+1 Thread of Destiny (Spell Failure)" or "+2 Threads (Major Negative Outcome)"

**Thread Spending Animation**:
When you spend Threads to call a specific card:
- **Cost Display**: "Call [A♠] - 2 Threads" button appears
- **Spending**: 2 segments drain from bar with reverse animation
- **Card Appearance**: The called card materializes from golden energy, spinning into your hand
- **Audio**: Magical whoosh sound, card shuffle sound
- **Text Popup**: "Called [A♠] from deck (-2 Threads)"

**Deck Display Integration**:
Your Threads gauge is positioned above your card deck display, showing:
- **Top Card Preview**: If you have Destiny's Insight passive, top card of deck shown
- **Cards in Hand**: Current cards drawn for active spell
- **Cards Remaining**: "Cards in deck: 47/52"
- **Call Card Interface**: Dropdown menu to select specific card to call (costs 2 Threads)

**Call Card Interface** (when you have 2+ Threads):
- **Button**: "Call Specific Card (2 Threads)" - glows when available
- **Click**: Opens card selector showing all 52 cards
- **Selection**: Click a card (e.g., A♠) → Confirmation "Call [A♠] for 2 Threads?"
- **Confirm**: Card is pulled from deck, added to your hand, 2 Threads spent
- **Limitation**: Once per turn (grayed out after use)

**Failure Feedback System**:
When a spell fails or produces negative outcome:
- **Spell Effect**: Shows failure animation (e.g., cards fizzling, bust explosion)
- **Thread Generation**: Golden threads emerge from the failure, flow to your bar
- **Positive Spin**: Text says "Failure converted to 1 Thread!" (not just "Spell Failed")
- **Visual**: Even failures look visually rewarding (golden energy, chimes, positive feedback)

**Strategic Indicators**:
- **At 0-3 Threads**: Tooltip says "Sparse Threads - accept failures to build"
- **At 4-6 Threads**: Tooltip says "Woven Strands - can call 2-3 cards, save for critical moments"
- **At 7-9 Threads**: Tooltip says "Tapestry of Fate - can call 3-4 cards, good reserve for manipulation"
- **At 10-12 Threads**: Tooltip says "Destiny's Web - can call 5-6 cards, aggressive manipulation available"
- **At 13 Threads**: Tooltip says "FATE MASTERED - The King's Power! Spend or waste generation!"

**Why This Matters**: The Threads of Destiny gauge transforms failures into victories. When you bust on Draw of the Damned and take damage, you don't just feel bad—you see 2 golden threads flow into your bar, hear the chime, and read "+2 Threads (Major Negative Outcome)". The visual feedback makes failures feel GOOD because they're building your power. Then, when you spend 8 Threads to call 4 specific cards and build a Royal Flush, you see each card materialize from golden energy, and you FEEL the payoff. At 13 Threads, you've achieved "Fate Mastered" - the King's power - and the bar glows with maximum intensity. The gauge isn't just a resource bar—it's a visual story of turning bad luck into good luck, one thread at a time.`

    mechanics: {
      title: 'How It Works',
      content: `**Thread Generation**: Fate Weavers generate Threads of Destiny whenever their spells fail or produce negative outcomes:
- **Spell Failure** (+1 Thread): When a spell fails to achieve its intended effect or produces no outcome
- **Minor Negative Outcome** (+1 Thread): When a spell produces a minor negative effect (e.g., drawing a heart in Heart's Gamble)
- **Major Negative Outcome** (+2 Threads): When a spell produces a severe negative effect (e.g., going far over 21 in Draw of the Damned)

**Thread Usage**: Spend Threads to manipulate your deck and control fate:
- **Call Specific Card** (2 Threads): Search the deck for a specific card and add it to your hand (once per turn)
- **Reweave Fate** (Passive): Automatically gain Threads when spells fail or backfire—failures are never wasted

**Thread Capacity**:
- **Maximum**: 13 Threads (representing the 13 cards per suit: Ace through King)
- **Starting**: 0 Threads
- **Persistence**: Threads persist between combats and can be stockpiled for crucial encounters

**Strategic Principle**: The Fate Weaver thrives on turning failures into opportunities. Early in combat, accept some failures to build Thread reserves. Later, spend Threads to guarantee success when it matters most.`

    strategicConsiderations: {
      title: 'Strategic Thread Management',
      content: `Mastering Threads of Destiny is the key to becoming an effective Fate Weaver. The resource creates a unique risk/reward dynamic where failures become opportunities and careful planning pays dividends.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Embrace Failure Early**: In the opening rounds of combat, accepting some failures builds Thread reserves for later
2. **Save for Criticals**: Don't spend Threads on minor spells—save them for game-changing moments
3. **Know Your Deck**: Track which cards have been drawn to predict what's left and plan Thread usage
4. **Emergency Reserve**: Always maintain 4-6 Threads for unexpected situations
5. **Cap Awareness**: At 13 Threads (Fate Mastered), you must spend or waste generation—don't let Threads go to waste

**Advanced Techniques**:
- **Intentional Failure**: Sometimes accepting a negative outcome to gain 2 Threads is worth it
- **Thread Cycling**: Spend Threads to call cards that enable Thread generation (risky cards)
- **Combo Setup**: Use Threads to assemble specific card combinations for powerful effects
- **Ally Coordination**: In Echo of Fate, coordinate with allies to ensure matching cards`
    },

    playingInPerson: {
      title: 'Playing Fate Weaver In Person',
      content: `**Required Materials**:
- **Standard 52-Card Deck** (no jokers)
- **13 Thread Tokens** (gold/silver tokens, beads, or coins)
- **Thread Tracker Card** (showing 0-13 Thread capacity)
- **Poker Hand Reference** (rankings for Hand of Fate spell)
- **Blackjack Reference** (card values for Draw of the Damned spell)
- **Discard Pile** (separate area for used cards)
- **Hand Holder** (optional, for organizing your current hand)

**Primary Tracking Method: Physical Playing Cards + Thread Tokens**

The Fate Weaver is the ONLY class that uses actual playing cards as their core mechanic. You shuffle a real deck, draw real cards, and use Thread tokens to manipulate your draws. This creates an incredibly immersive, tactile experience where you're literally playing card games within your TTRPG.

**Setup**:
\`\`\`
FATE WEAVER SETUP:

DECK: [52 cards, shuffled] ← Your spell deck
HAND: [5 cards] ← Current hand (max 5, or 7 for Card Master)
DISCARD: [Used cards] ← Reshuffled when deck runs out

THREADS OF DESTINY: [○][○][○][○][○][○][○][○][○][○][○][○][○]
Current: 0/13 (max = 13, one per card rank Ace-King)

THREAD GENERATION:
• Spell fails or has no effect: +1 Thread
• Spell has negative outcome: +1-2 Threads (severity-based)

THREAD SPENDING:
• Call Specific Card: 2 Threads (once per turn)
• Look at Top 3 Cards: 1 Thread (choose which to draw)
\`\`\`

**How It Works**:

**Drawing Cards**:
1. Shuffle your 52-card deck at the start of combat
2. Draw 5 cards to form your starting hand
3. When you cast a card-based spell, you draw/play cards from your hand
4. When your hand is empty or you need more cards, draw from the deck
5. When the deck runs out, reshuffle the discard pile

**Generating Threads**:
1. **Spell Fails**: If a card-based spell fails or has no effect → +1 Thread token
2. **Negative Outcome**: If a spell hurts you or backfires → +1-2 Thread tokens
3. **Blackjack Bust**: If you bust in Draw of the Damned → +2 Thread tokens
4. **Poker Hand Fails**: If you can't make the required hand → +1 Thread token

**Spending Threads**:
1. **Call Specific Card** (2 Threads, once per turn):
   - Announce which card you want (e.g., "Ace of Spades")
   - Search your deck for that card
   - Add it to your hand
   - Reshuffle the deck

2. **Look at Top 3** (1 Thread, when drawing):
   - Look at top 3 cards of deck
   - Choose which one to draw
   - Put the other 2 on bottom of deck in any order

**Example Card-Based Spell: Hand of Fate (Poker)**

*You cast Hand of Fate, which requires you to make a poker hand*

**Your Current Hand**: [7♠][7♥][K♦][3♣][9♠]

**Turn 1 - Natural Draw**:
1. "I cast Hand of Fate!"
2. Look at your hand: You have a pair of 7s
3. **Pair** = 2d6 damage → Roll [4,5] = 9 damage
4. Discard the 5 cards used
5. No Threads generated (spell succeeded)

**Turn 2 - Bad Draw**:
1. Draw 5 new cards: [2♠][5♥][8♦][J♣][K♠]
2. "I cast Hand of Fate again!"
3. Look at your hand: No pairs, no straights, no flushes
4. **High Card** = 1d4 damage → Roll [2] = 2 damage (weak!)
5. Discard the 5 cards
6. **Generate 1 Thread** (spell was weak/ineffective)
7. Add 1 gold token to Thread pool → **1 Thread**

**Turn 3 - Using Threads to Call Cards**:
1. Draw 5 new cards: [4♠][6♥][9♦][Q♣][A♠]
2. "I spend 2 Threads to call Ace of Hearts!"
3. Remove 2 gold tokens → **0 Threads** (spent 2, had 1... wait, need 2!)
4. Actually, you only have 1 Thread, so you can't call a card yet
5. Cast Hand of Fate with current hand: No pairs
6. **High Card** again = 1d4 damage
7. **Generate 1 Thread** → **2 Threads** total

**Turn 4 - Now You Can Call Cards**:
1. Draw 5 new cards: [3♠][8♥][10♦][J♣][K♠]
2. "I spend 2 Threads to call Ace of Spades!"
3. Remove 2 gold tokens → **0 Threads**
4. Search deck for A♠, add to hand
5. Discard one card (K♠) to make room
6. New hand: [3♠][8♥][10♦][J♣][A♠]
7. "I spend 2 more Threads to call Ace of Hearts!"
8. Wait, you have 0 Threads now, can't call another card
9. Cast Hand of Fate: Still just high card
10. **Generate 1 Thread** → **1 Thread**

**Turn 5 - Building Toward Royal Flush**:
1. You need 4 more Threads to call 2 more cards
2. Accept some failures to build Threads
3. Eventually, with enough Threads, you can call:
   - 10♠, J♠, Q♠, K♠, A♠ = **ROYAL FLUSH!**
   - 10d10 damage → Roll [8,9,10,7,6,8,9,10,7,8] = 82 damage!

**Example Card-Based Spell: Draw of the Damned (Blackjack)**

*You cast Draw of the Damned, which uses blackjack rules*

**Turn 1 - Safe Play**:
1. "I cast Draw of the Damned!"
2. Draw 2 cards: [K♠][7♥] = 17 (King = 10, 7 = 7)
3. "I stand at 17"
4. Deal 3d6 damage → Roll [4,5,6] = 15 damage
5. Discard cards
6. No Threads generated (safe play, no bust)

**Turn 2 - Risky Play**:

**Alternative Tracking Methods**:

**Method 1: Digital Deck + Physical Threads**
- Use a card shuffler app on phone/tablet
- Track Threads with physical tokens
- Faster shuffling, less table space
- Loses some tactile immersion

**Method 2: Dice Instead of Cards**
- Use dice to simulate card draws (d13 for rank, d4 for suit)
- Track Threads with tokens
- No deck needed, but less thematic
- Harder to visualize poker hands

**Method 3: Card Tiles**
- Use card tiles or tokens instead of full deck
- Easier to organize and see hands
- More durable than paper cards
- More expensive to acquire

**Method 4: Minimalist Paper Tracking**
- Write drawn cards on paper
- Track Threads with tally marks
- No materials needed
- Loses all tactile card-playing experience

**Thread Reference Card**:
\`\`\`
THREADS OF DESTINY REFERENCE

GENERATION:
• Spell fails/no effect: +1 Thread
• Negative outcome (minor): +1 Thread
• Negative outcome (major): +2 Threads
• Blackjack bust: +2 Threads
• Poker high card: +1 Thread

SPENDING:
• Call Specific Card: 2 Threads (once/turn)
• Look at Top 3 Cards: 1 Thread (when drawing)

MAXIMUM: 13 Threads (Ace through King)

STRATEGY:
0-3 Threads: Build reserves, accept failures
4-6 Threads: Spend on critical spells only
7-9 Threads: Spend freely on important moments
10-12 Threads: Aggressive manipulation
13 Threads: At cap, must spend or waste
\`\`\`

**Example In-Person Turn**:

*You have 6 Threads, fighting a dragon*

**Turn 1 - Build Toward Royal Flush**:
1. "I cast Hand of Fate!"
2. Current hand: [2♠][5♥][9♦][J♣][K♠]
3. "I spend 2 Threads to call 10 of Spades!"
4. Remove 2 tokens → **4 Threads**
5. Search deck, add 10♠ to hand
6. Discard 2♠ to make room
7. New hand: [5♥][9♦][J♣][K♠][10♠]

**Turn 2 - Continue Building**:
1. "I spend 2 Threads to call Queen of Spades!"
2. Remove 2 tokens → **2 Threads**
3. Add Q♠ to hand, discard 5♥
4. New hand: [9♦][J♣][K♠][10♠][Q♠]
5. Not enough Threads to call more cards yet

**Turn 3 - Accept Failure to Build Threads**:
1. Cast a different spell that fails
2. **Generate 1 Thread** → **3 Threads**
3. Still need more Threads

**Turn 4 - Final Assembly**:
1. "I spend 2 Threads to call Jack of Spades!"
2. Remove 2 tokens → **1 Thread**
3. Add J♠ to hand, discard 9♦
4. New hand: [J♣][K♠][10♠][Q♠][J♠]
5. Wait, I have J♣ and J♠, but I need all spades for Royal Flush
6. Need to call Ace of Spades and discard J♣
7. Not enough Threads! Need to build more

**Turn 5 - More Thread Building**:
1. Accept another failure
2. **Generate 1 Thread** → **2 Threads**

**Turn 6 - ROYAL FLUSH!**:
1. "I spend 2 Threads to call Ace of Spades!"
2. Remove 2 tokens → **0 Threads**
3. Add A♠ to hand, discard J♣
4. Final hand: [K♠][10♠][Q♠][J♠][A♠]
5. "I cast Hand of Fate with ROYAL FLUSH!"
6. Deal 10d10 damage → [8,9,10,7,6,8,9,10,7,8] = 82 damage to dragon!
7. Discard all 5 cards

**Quick Reference Card Template**:
\`\`\`
FATE WEAVER QUICK REFERENCE

CARD-BASED SPELLS:
• Hand of Fate: Poker hands (pair to royal flush)
• Draw of the Damned: Blackjack (17-21 or bust)
• Card Cascade: Play multiple cards in sequence
• Perfect Hand: Draw until you get specific hand

THREAD MECHANICS:
• Generate from failures and negative outcomes
• Spend to call specific cards (2 Threads)
• Spend to look at top 3 cards (1 Thread)
• Maximum 13 Threads (don't waste generation!)

POKER HANDS:
Royal Flush > Straight Flush > Four of a Kind >
Full House > Flush > Straight > Three of a Kind >
Two Pair > Pair > High Card

BLACKJACK:
21 = 6d6 | 20 = 5d6 | 19 = 4d6 | 18 = 4d6
17 = 3d6 | 16- = 2d6 | BUST = -3d6 + 2 Threads
\`\`\`

**Thematic Enhancements**:

Many players enhance the Fate Weaver experience with:
- **Tarot Deck**: Use tarot cards instead of playing cards for mystical theme
- **Golden Threads**: Use gold thread or string as Thread tokens
- **Card Sleeves**: Protect cards with themed sleeves (stars, fate symbols)
- **Dealer Visor**: Wear a card dealer visor for immersion
- **Card Shuffler**: Automatic shuffler for faster gameplay
- **Fate Dice**: Special dice for rolling damage based on poker hands

**Thread Management Tips**:

**Building Strategy**:
- **Accept Early Failures**: First 2-3 turns, accept some failures to build Threads
- **Know Your Limits**: Don't push for risky plays unless you have Thread backup
- **Track Deck**: Remember which cards have been played to predict draws
- **Emergency Reserve**: Keep 4-6 Threads for critical moments

**Spending Strategy**:
- **Royal Flush Assembly**: Save 10+ Threads to call all 5 cards for Royal Flush
- **Blackjack 21**: Spend 2 Threads to call the exact card you need for 21
- **Combo Setup**: Use Threads to assemble specific card combinations
- **Don't Waste**: At 13 Threads, spend liberally to avoid wasting generation

**Card Game Strategy**:
- **Poker**: Aim for straights and flushes (easier than four of a kind)
- **Blackjack**: Stand at 18-20 for safety, hit at 11-16 for higher damage
- **Deck Tracking**: Count cards to know what's left in the deck
- **Suit Awareness**: Track which suits have been played for flush potential

**Why This System Works**: The Fate Weaver is the ONLY class that uses actual playing cards, creating a unique, tactile experience. The physical act of shuffling, drawing, and playing cards makes you feel like you're actually manipulating fate. The Thread tokens represent your ability to "cheat" the deck by calling specific cards, transforming randomness into strategy. The tension of deciding whether to accept a bad hand (and gain Threads) or spend Threads to guarantee a good hand creates meaningful decisions every turn. The dramatic moment of assembling a Royal Flush by calling all 5 cards is incredibly satisfying and memorable.

**Pro Tips**:
- **Shuffle Thoroughly**: Shuffle deck well between combats to ensure randomness
- **Track Discards**: Keep discard pile organized to know when to reshuffle
- **Poker Knowledge**: Learn poker hand rankings to maximize Hand of Fate
- **Blackjack Math**: Know when to hit/stand based on current total
- **Thread Banking**: Build to 10+ Threads before attempting Royal Flush
- **Specialization Synergy**: Fortune Teller = ally support, Card Master = combo focus, Thread Weaver = failure conversion

**Budget-Friendly Alternatives**:
- **No playing cards?** Use dice to simulate draws (d13 for rank, d4 for suit)
- **No Thread tokens?** Use coins, buttons, or tally marks
- **No card holder?** Just hold cards in hand or lay them on table
- **Minimalist**: Track card draws on paper, use tally marks for Threads

**Specialization-Specific Tracking**:

**Fortune Teller**:
- Can share cards with allies (give them cards from your hand)
- Track which allies have your cards
- Bond with ally: They use your Thread pool
- Mark bonded ally on character sheet

**Card Master**:
- Hold up to 7 cards (instead of 5)
- When calling cards, call 2 cards for 2 Threads (not 1)
- Free discard/draw once per turn
- Use larger hand holder or spread cards on table

**Thread Weaver**:
- Generate +1 Thread from all sources (failures give 2, not 1)
- Can spend Threads to force failures (intentional bad outcomes)
- Track bonus Thread generation separately
- More aggressive Thread spending

**Why Fate Weaver Is Perfect for In-Person Play**: The class is literally built around playing card games at the table. You shuffle a real deck, draw real cards, make real poker hands and blackjack totals. The Thread tokens let you "cheat" by calling specific cards, creating a satisfying blend of luck and skill. The physical act of assembling a Royal Flush by searching the deck for each card, one by one, is incredibly immersive. Every card draw is exciting, every Thread spent is strategic, and every poker hand or blackjack total creates tension. It's a class that transforms your TTRPG into a casino, making it perfect for players who love card games and tactical resource management.`
