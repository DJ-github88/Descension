    description: `The Martyr is a devoted protector who draws strength from unwavering faith and willingness to endure suffering for their allies. Through the Devotion Gauge mechanic, Martyrs transform pain into power, unlocking increasingly potent abilities as they take damage and perform sacrificial acts. Each wound they bear becomes a blessing for their companions.`,
    
    roleplayIdentity: {
      title: 'Roleplay Identity',
      content: `Martyrs are driven by unshakeable conviction—whether religious faith, loyalty to a cause, or devotion to their companions. They have sworn oaths to protect others, even at the cost of their own lives. This dedication manifests as divine power that grows stronger the more they sacrifice.

Their devotion often shows physically: scars that glow with holy light, stigmata that bleed radiant energy, or an aura of serenity even in the midst of agony. At high Devotion Levels, they may appear transfigured—wreathed in golden light, bearing phantom wings, or surrounded by spectral guardians.

Common Martyr archetypes include:
- **The Penitent Knight**: Atoning for past sins through selfless service
- **The Faithful Shepherd**: Protecting their flock from all harm
- **The Oath-Bound Guardian**: Sworn to defend a person, place, or ideal
- **The Suffering Saint**: Believes pain brings them closer to the divine
- **The Living Shield**: Finds purpose in being the wall between danger and innocents

Martyrs understand that true strength comes not from avoiding pain, but from enduring it for others. They see each wound as a badge of honor, each sacrifice as a prayer made manifest.`

    combatRole: {
      title: 'Combat Role',
      content: `The Martyr is a hybrid support/tank class that excels at:

**Damage Mitigation**: Intercepting attacks meant for allies and redirecting harm to themselves
**Sustained Healing**: Converting their own suffering into healing power for the party
**Protective Buffs**: Granting resistance, temporary HP, and defensive bonuses
**Radiant Damage**: Channeling devotion into holy attacks against enemies

**Strengths**:
- Excellent at protecting vulnerable allies
- Scales in power as combat becomes more dangerous
- Strong sustained healing capabilities
- Can turn near-death situations into victory through high Devotion abilities
- Provides both defensive and offensive support

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires taking damage to reach full potential
- Can become overwhelmed if focused by too many enemies
- Less effective when allies are spread out
- Devotion spending requires careful resource management
- Vulnerable to burst damage before building Devotion

The Martyr shines in prolonged encounters where they can build Devotion Levels and unleash devastating amplified abilities at critical moments.`

    playstyle: {
      title: 'Playstyle & Strategy',
      content: `Playing a Martyr is about strategic sacrifice and resource management. Key considerations:

**Building Devotion**:
- Take damage naturally through combat (10/20/40/60/80/100 damage thresholds)
- Use Martyr's Intervene to protect allies and advance Devotion faster
- Some spells inflict self-damage to build Devotion while providing benefits
- Balance building Devotion with staying alive

**Devotion Level Strategy**:
- **Level 1-2 (Building Phase)**: Basic defensive benefits, focus on accumulating damage
- **Level 3-4 (Power Phase)**: Strong passive effects, moderate amplification power
- **Level 5-6 (Peak Phase)**: Powerful auras and devastating amplified abilities

**Spending Devotion**:
- Amplified spells cost 1-5 Devotion Levels for enhanced effects
- Save high Devotion for critical moments (boss fights, emergencies)
- Consider whether passive benefits outweigh active spending
- Some situations require immediate amplified healing over passive bonuses

**Specialization Synergies**:
- **Redemption**: Maximum healing and protection, defensive playstyle
- **Zealot**: Aggressive damage-dealing through suffering, offensive support
- **Ascetic**: Balanced endurance, maintains high Devotion efficiently

**Team Dynamics**:
- Position near vulnerable allies to use Intervene effectively
- Coordinate with tanks to share damage absorption duties
- Communicate Devotion Levels so team knows when big abilities are ready
- Synergizes with classes that benefit from resistance and temp HP buffs`

    immersiveCombatExample: {
      title: 'Combat Example: The Sacred Sacrifice',
      content: `**The Setup**: You're a Martyr (Redemption specialization) and your party is fighting a demon lord and its minions (1 demon lord + 3 lesser demons). Your party's mage is low on HP and about to be attacked. Starting HP: 100/100. Devotion Level: 0 (no damage taken yet). Starting Mana: 50/60. Your goal: Build Devotion by taking damage, protect your allies, and unleash amplified healing at critical moments.

**Starting State**: HP: 100/100 | Devotion Level: 0 (0 damage taken) | Mana: 50/60

**DEVOTION LEVEL 0 (0 damage taken)**

**Turn 1 - First Sacrifice (HP: 100 → 85, Devotion: 0 → 1)**

*The demon lord roars, and a lesser demon charges your mage. She's at 20 HP—one hit will kill her. You step between them.*

**Your Action**: Martyr's Intervene (reaction, no mana cost)
**Effect**: Redirect attack from ally to yourself

*You raise your shield. "Strike me instead!" The demon's claws rake across your armor.*

**Demon's Attack**: Redirected to you → [18] → Hit! → 2d8+5 → [7, 8] + 5 = **20 damage**
**Your HP**: 100 - 20 = 80/100
**Total Damage Taken**: 20 damage

**Devotion Check**: 20 damage taken ≥ 10 damage threshold → **Devotion Level 1 achieved!**

*Golden light flares around you. Your first wound glows with radiant energy. You feel the divine power awakening.*

**Devotion Level**: 0 → **1**
**Passive Benefit (Level 1)**: +1 AC to all allies within 10 ft

**Your Party's Mage**: "You... you took that hit for me."
**You**: "That's what I'm here for. My pain is your protection."

**Current State**: HP: 80/100 | Devotion Level: 1 (20 damage) | Mana: 50/60

**Turn 2 - Building Devotion (HP: 80 → 60, Devotion: 1 → 2)**

*Two lesser demons attack you. Good. Let them come.*

**Lesser Demon #1's Turn**: Attacks you → [16] → Hit! → 1d10+3 → [7] + 3 = **10 damage**
**Your HP**: 80 - 10 = 70/100
**Total Damage Taken**: 20 + 10 = 30 damage

**Lesser Demon #2's Turn**: Attacks you → [17] → Hit! → 1d10+3 → [8] + 3 = **11 damage**
**Your HP**: 70 - 11 = 59/100
**Total Damage Taken**: 30 + 11 = 41 damage

**Devotion Check**: 41 damage ≥ 40 damage threshold → **Devotion Level 2 achieved!**

*More wounds. More light. Your scars glow brighter. The divine power SURGES.*

**Devotion Level**: 1 → **2**
**Passive Benefit (Level 2)**: +1 AC to allies + Allies within 10 ft gain resistance to first damage type taken

**Your Action**: Cast "Sacred Shield" on your mage (6 mana)
**Effect**: Grant 15 temporary HP

*You extend your hand. Golden light flows from your wounds to your mage, forming a protective barrier.*

**Mana**: 50 - 6 = 44/60

**Your Party's Mage**: "I can feel your protection. Thank you."

**Current State**: HP: 59/100 | Devotion Level: 2 (41 damage) | Mana: 44/60

**Turn 3 - Reaching Peak Devotion (HP: 59 → 39, Devotion: 2 → 3)**

*The demon lord strikes you with a massive flaming sword.*

**Demon Lord's Turn**: Attacks you → [19] → Hit! → 3d10+6 fire → [8, 9, 7] + 6 = **30 fire damage**
**Your HP**: 59 - 30 = 29/100
**Total Damage Taken**: 41 + 30 = 71 damage

**Devotion Check**: 71 damage ≥ 60 damage threshold → **Devotion Level 3 achieved!**

*You fall to one knee, bleeding. But the light around you is BLINDING. Your wounds are RADIANT. You've never felt more powerful.*

**Devotion Level**: 2 → **3**
**Passive Benefit (Level 3)**: +2 AC to allies + Resistance to first damage type + Allies heal 1d6 HP per turn within 10 ft

**Your Party's Tank**: "You're glowing like the sun! Are you okay?"
**You**: "I'm at 29 HP. But I'm at Devotion Level 3. I can save us all now."

**Your Action**: Cast "Radiant Burst" at Demon Lord (8 mana)
**Attack Roll**: d20+5 → [16] = Hit!
**Damage**: 3d8 radiant → [7, 6, 8] = **21 radiant damage**

*Holy light erupts from your wounds, striking the demon lord.*

**Mana**: 44 - 8 = 36/60

**Current State**: HP: 29/100 | Devotion Level: 3 (71 damage) | Mana: 36/60

**Turn 4 - Amplified Healing (HP: 29 → 24, Devotion: 3 → 1)**

*You're at 29 HP. Your party's mage is at 20 HP. Your tank is at 40 HP. Time to HEAL.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Mass Healing Prayer" AMPLIFIED (12 mana + 2 Devotion Levels)

*You raise your arms. Your wounds BLAZE with golden light. The radiance flows outward, healing everyone.*

**Amplification Cost**: 2 Devotion Levels
**Devotion Level**: 3 - 2 = **1**

**Base Healing**: 3d8 to all allies → [6, 7, 8] = 21 HP to each ally
**Amplification Bonus**: +2d8 per Devotion Level spent (2 levels) = +4d8 → [7, 6, 8, 5] = +26 HP
**Total Healing**: 21 + 26 = **47 HP to each ally!**

*Your party is BATHED in golden light. Wounds close. Strength returns.*

**Your HP**: 29 + 47 = 76/100
**Your Party's Mage**: 20 + 47 = 67/70
**Your Party's Tank**: 40 + 47 = 87/90

**Mana**: 36 - 12 = 24/60

**Self-Damage (Amplified Spell Cost)**: Amplified spells inflict 1d6 self-damage per Devotion Level spent
**Self-Damage Roll**: 2d6 (2 Devotion Levels) → [3, 2] = **5 damage**
**Your HP**: 76 - 5 = 71/100
**Total Damage Taken**: 71 + 5 = 76 damage

*You stagger from the self-inflicted pain. But your party is healed. Worth it.*

**Devotion Check**: 76 damage ≥ 60 threshold → Still at Devotion Level 1 (lost 2 levels from spending, but still above 60 damage total)

**Current State**: HP: 71/100 | Devotion Level: 1 (76 damage) | Mana: 24/60

**Turn 5 - Finishing the Fight**

*Your party is healed. The demon lord is wounded. Time to finish this.*

**Your Party's Mage**: Casts Fireball at Demon Lord → 45 damage → Demon Lord DEAD
**Your Party's Tank**: Attacks Lesser Demon #1 → DEAD
**Your Party's Rogue**: Sneak attacks Lesser Demon #2 → DEAD

**Lesser Demon #3's Turn**: Attacks you → [15] → Hit! → 1d10+3 → [6] + 3 = **9 damage**
**Your HP**: 71 - 9 = 62/100
**Total Damage Taken**: 76 + 9 = 85 damage

**Devotion Check**: 85 damage ≥ 80 threshold → **Devotion Level 4 achieved!**

*Even more light. Your wounds are like stars.*

**Devotion Level**: 1 → **4**

**Your Action**: Cast "Smite" at Lesser Demon #3 (6 mana)
**Attack Roll**: d20+5 → [18] = Hit!
**Damage**: 2d10 radiant → [9, 8] = **17 radiant damage**
**Result**: Lesser Demon #3 DEAD

**Combat Over**

*You stand among the demon corpses, bleeding but victorious. Your wounds glow with fading golden light.*

**Your Party's Mage**: "You healed me for FORTY-SEVEN HP. How?"
**You**: "I spent 2 Devotion Levels to amplify Mass Healing Prayer. Base healing was 21 HP, amplification added +26 HP. Total 47 HP to everyone."
**Your Party's Tank**: "But you took damage from it?"
**You**: "Amplified spells cost self-damage. 1d6 per Devotion Level spent. I took 5 damage. Small price for saving the party."
**Your Party's Rogue**: "You took 85 damage total. You're at Devotion Level 4 now."
**You**: "Every wound is a blessing. Every sacrifice brings me closer to the divine. That's the Martyr's way."

**Final State**: HP: 62/100 | Devotion Level: 4 (85 damage) | Mana: 18/60

**The Lesson**: Martyr gameplay is about:
1. **Building Devotion**: Took 85 damage total, reached Devotion Level 4 (thresholds: 10/20/40/60/80/100)
2. **Martyr's Intervene**: Redirected attack from mage to yourself Turn 1, gained 20 damage toward Devotion
3. **Passive Benefits**: Devotion Level 3 gave +2 AC to allies, resistance to first damage type, 1d6 HP regen per turn
4. **Amplified Healing**: Spent 2 Devotion Levels to amplify Mass Healing Prayer: 21 HP → 47 HP (+26 from amplification)
5. **Self-Damage Cost**: Amplified spell cost 2d6 self-damage (5 damage), but healed party for 47 HP each
6. **Resource Management**: Spent 2 Devotion Levels (3 → 1) for critical healing, then rebuilt to Level 4
7. **Damage Thresholds**: 10 (Level 1) → 20 (Level 2) → 40 (Level 3) → 60 (Level 4) → 80 (Level 5) → 100 (Level 6)

You're not a traditional healer. You're a LIVING SACRIFICE. You WANT to take damage because it builds Devotion. You intercept attacks meant for allies. You endure suffering. And when your Devotion is high, you unleash AMPLIFIED abilities that can turn the tide of battle. The key is balancing building Devotion (taking damage) with spending it (amplified spells). Save high Devotion for critical moments—when your party needs massive healing or devastating attacks. Your wounds are your power. Your pain is their salvation.`

**Why This Matters**: The Devotion Gauge makes you FEEL like a living sacrifice. When you take 20 damage and the first segment LIGHTS UP with golden glow, you see "Devotion Level 1 - Flickering Faith" and your character starts to shimmer. When you reach Level 3 and your wounds begin to GLOW, you see the "+1 AC to allies" buff appear on your party members—your suffering is PROTECTING them. When you hit Level 6 at 100 damage and your character TRANSFORMS with angelic wings and a halo, the "Allies resist ALL damage" notification appears, and you see golden shields on your entire party—you've become a CELESTIAL PROTECTOR. The amplified spell interface makes the decision clear: spend 2 Devotion Levels for massive healing, but lose your passive benefits. When you cast that amplified Mass Healing Prayer and see "47 HP healed!" on all allies, you KNOW the sacrifice was worth it. Every wound is power. Every sacrifice is salvation.`

    mechanics: {
      title: 'How It Works',
      content: `**Starting State**: All Martyrs begin combat at Devotion Level 0

**Building Devotion**:
- **Taking Damage**: Accumulate damage to reach thresholds (10/20/40/60/80/100)
- **Martyr's Intervene**: Rush in front of an ally to take damage meant for them (advances 1 level per use)
- **Self-Sacrifice Spells**: Some spells inflict self-damage to build Devotion while providing benefits
- **Damage Tracking**: Total damage taken persists through combat to track Devotion Level

**Devotion Levels**: Six levels (1-6), each with unique passive effects
**Level Persistence**: Devotion Levels persist between combats until you rest or are fully healed
**Maximum Level**: Devotion Level 6 is the maximum

**Passive Effects**: Each Devotion Level grants a permanent passive benefit while at that level
**Amplified Spells**: Spend Devotion Levels to cast enhanced versions of spells
**Spending Devotion**: Using amplified abilities reduces your Devotion Level by the cost (1-5 levels)

**Martyr's Intervene**: 
As a reaction, rush in front of an ally within 10 feet who is about to take damage, taking the damage instead. This action increases the Devotion Gauge by 1 level each time it is used, regardless of damage amount.`

    strategicConsiderations: {
      title: 'Strategic Considerations',
      content: `**Devotion 0-2 (Building Phase)**: Focus on taking damage and using Intervene to build Devotion quickly. Passive benefits are minimal, prioritize accumulation.
**Devotion 3-4 (Power Phase)**: Strong passive benefits active (damage reduction, radiant damage). Good time for amplified healing and moderate power spells.
**Devotion 5-6 (Peak Phase)**: Maximum power with aura effects. Decide whether to maintain passives or spend on ultimate amplified abilities.

**Intervene Strategy**: 
- Use proactively to protect squishy allies (mages, healers)
- Fastest way to build Devotion (1 level per use regardless of damage)
- Requires positioning within 10 feet of allies
- Can advance from Level 1 to Level 2 even if you've only taken 11 damage total

**Amplified Spell Timing**:
- Save 3-5 Devotion spending for boss fights and emergencies
- Use 1-2 Devotion spends more liberally for tactical advantages
- Consider passive loss when spending (losing Level 6 resistance aura is significant)
- Some amplified effects are worth more than passive benefits in critical moments

**Self-Damage Spells**:
- Penance of Pain, Purifying Pain, and similar spells build Devotion while helping allies
- Calculate whether self-damage is worth the Devotion gain and healing output
- Synergizes with Redemption spec's healing bonuses
- Risk vs reward: don't kill yourself building Devotion`

    playingInPerson: {
      title: 'Playing Martyr In Person',
      content: `**Required Materials**:
- **6 Devotion Level Tokens** (gold/white tokens, coins, or beads)
- **Damage Counter** (d100 or paper tracker)
- **Devotion Level Card** (reference card showing passive effects)
- **Amplified Spell Cards** (optional, for tracking available amplifications)
- **Intervene Tracker** (optional, for counting Intervene uses)

**Primary Tracking Method: Devotion Level Tokens**

The Martyr's Devotion Gauge is tracked using 6 physical tokens arranged vertically to represent the 6 Devotion Levels. As you take damage and use Intervene, you activate tokens from bottom to top, each unlocking powerful passive effects.

**Setup**:
\`\`\`
DEVOTION GAUGE (Vertical Stack):

[6] ○ - Level 6: Celestial Protector (100 dmg / 6 Intervenes)
[5] ○ - Level 5: Holy Martyrdom (80 dmg / 5 Intervenes)
[4] ○ - Level 4: Divine Ascendance (60 dmg / 4 Intervenes)
[3] ○ - Level 3: Radiant Sacrifice (40 dmg / 3 Intervenes)
[2] ○ - Level 2: Steadfast Conviction (20 dmg / 2 Intervenes)
[1] ○ - Level 1: Flickering Faith (10 dmg / 1 Intervene)

DAMAGE TAKEN: [___] / 100
INTERVENE COUNT: [___]
\`\`\`

**How It Works**:

**Building Devotion Through Damage**:
1. Track total damage taken on a d100 or paper
2. When you reach a threshold (10/20/40/60/80/100), flip the corresponding token to "active"
3. Active tokens glow (face up), inactive tokens are dark (face down)
4. Each active token grants its passive effect immediately

**Building Devotion Through Intervene**:
1. When you use Martyr's Intervene (take damage for an ally), mark it
2. Each Intervene use advances Devotion by 1 level regardless of damage
3. Flip the next token to "active"
4. This is the fastest way to build Devotion

**Example Devotion Building**:

*Starting: 0 damage, Level 0, all tokens face down*

**Turn 1**: Take 12 damage from orc attack
- Damage: 12/100
- Flip token [1] face up → **Level 1: Flickering Faith**
- **Passive Active**: Gain 5 temp HP when ally within 5 ft takes damage

**Turn 2**: Use Intervene to protect mage from goblin attack (take 8 damage)
- Damage: 20/100
- Intervene Count: 1
- Flip token [2] face up → **Level 2: Steadfast Conviction**
- **Passive Active**: All healing +5 HP

**Turn 3**: Take 25 damage from troll smash
- Damage: 45/100
- Flip token [3] face up → **Level 3: Radiant Sacrifice**
- **Passive Active**: Allies within 10 ft gain +1 AC

**Turn 4**: Use Intervene to protect rogue (take 10 damage)
- Damage: 55/100
- Intervene Count: 2
- Flip token [4] face up → **Level 4: Divine Ascendance**
- **Passive Active**: Advantage on all saving throws

**Current State**: Level 4, 55 damage taken, 4 passive effects active

**Spending Devotion for Amplified Spells**:

When you cast an amplified spell, you spend Devotion Levels by flipping tokens back to "inactive" (face down):

**Example Amplified Spell**:
- You're at Level 4 (4 tokens active)
- Cast "Amplified Divine Healing" (costs 3 Devotion Levels)
- Flip tokens [4], [3], [2] face down → Now at Level 1
- Lose passives from Levels 2-4, keep Level 1 passive
- Spell heals for 6d8 + 15 HP (instead of normal 3d8)

**Alternative Tracking Methods**:

**Method 1: Vertical Token Stack**
- Stack 6 tokens vertically
- Add tokens to the stack as you gain Devotion Levels
- Remove from top when spending Devotion
- Visual height shows current power level

**Method 2: Devotion Dial**
- Use a d6 or spinner to show current Devotion Level
- Rotate up as you gain levels, down as you spend
- Quick and simple, but doesn't show damage taken

**Method 3: Damage Tracker + Level Card**
- Track damage on d100 or paper
- Reference card shows which level you're at
- Check off Intervene uses separately
- Minimalist approach

**Example In-Person Turn**:

*You're at Devotion Level 2 (25 damage taken), fighting alongside your party*

**Turn 1 - Intervene**:
1. "The dragon breathes fire at our mage! I use Martyr's Intervene!"
2. Take 30 damage for the mage → Total damage: 55
3. Intervene Count: 1
4. Flip token [3] face up → **Level 3**
5. Announce: "I'm now at Devotion Level 3! All allies within 10 feet gain +1 AC!"

**Turn 2 - Build More Devotion**:
1. Troll attacks you directly → Take 18 damage
2. Total damage: 73
3. Flip token [4] face up → **Level 4**
4. Announce: "Devotion Level 4! I have advantage on all saving throws!"

**Turn 3 - Amplified Healing**:
1. "Our tank is at 15 HP! I cast Amplified Divine Healing for 3 Devotion Levels!"
2. Flip tokens [4], [3], [2] face down → Back to Level 1
3. Roll healing: 6d8 + 15 → [6, 7, 5, 8, 4, 6] + 15 = 51 HP healed!
4. Announce: "I'm back to Level 1, but our tank is fully healed!"

\`\`\`

**Thematic Enhancements**:

Many players enhance the Martyr experience with:
- **Golden Tokens**: Use gold coins or beads for Devotion Levels
- **Glowing Dice**: LED dice that light up when at high Devotion
- **Stigmata Markers**: Small red markers to show wounds taken
- **Holy Symbol**: Keep a cross or holy symbol on the table
- **Radiant Aura**: LED tea light that brightens at high Devotion
- **Sacrifice Counter**: Tally marks for each Intervene use

**Devotion Management Tips**:

**Building Strategy**:
- **Intervene Aggressively**: Fastest way to build Devotion (1 level per use)
- **Position Near Allies**: Stay within 10 ft to use Intervene
- **Accept Damage**: Don't dodge attacks, let them hit to build Devotion
- **Self-Damage Spells**: Use Penance of Pain to build while healing allies

**Spending Strategy**:
- **Save for Emergencies**: Keep 4+ levels for critical moments
- **Tactical Spending**: Use 1-2 levels for moderate advantages
- **Passive Awareness**: Know what you lose when spending
- **Boss Fights**: Build to Level 6, then unleash massive amplifications

**Passive Effect Tracking**:

**Level 1 Active**:
- When ally within 5 ft takes damage, you gain 5 temp HP
- Track temp HP separately from regular HP

**Level 2 Active**:
- All healing +5 HP (add to every heal you cast)
- Announce bonus when healing

**Level 3 Active**:
- Allies within 10 ft gain +1 AC
- Remind allies of bonus when they're attacked

**Level 4 Active**:
- You have advantage on all saves
- Roll 2d20 for every saving throw

**Level 5 Active**:
- +10 radiant damage on all attacks
- Add to every weapon attack or spell attack

**Level 6 Active**:
- Allies within 15 ft gain resistance to all damage
- Halve all damage allies take (huge defensive aura)

**Example Full Combat Sequence**:

*Starting: 0 damage, Level 0*

**Turn 1**: Take 15 damage → Level 1 (temp HP when ally hit)
**Turn 2**: Intervene for mage → Level 2 (all healing +5)
**Turn 3**: Take 25 damage → Level 3 (allies +1 AC)
**Turn 4**: Intervene for rogue → Level 4 (advantage on saves)
**Turn 5**: Take 22 damage → Level 5 (+10 radiant damage)
**Turn 6**: Intervene for tank → Level 6 (allies resist all damage)
**Turn 7**: Cast Amplified Divine Smite (5 Devotion) → 10d8 radiant damage!
**Result**: Back to Level 1, but boss takes massive damage!

**Visual Organization**:

**Devotion Display Layout**:
\`\`\`
DEVOTION GAUGE: [●][●][●][○][○][○] (Level 3)

ACTIVE PASSIVES:
✓ Level 1: +5 temp HP when ally hit
✓ Level 2: All healing +5 HP
✓ Level 3: Allies within 10 ft +1 AC

DAMAGE TAKEN: 45/100
INTERVENE COUNT: 1
\`\`\`

**Battlefield Tracking**:
- **Devotion Tokens**: Vertical stack showing current level
- **Damage Counter**: d100 or paper showing total damage
- **Intervene Tally**: Mark each Intervene use
- **Passive Reminder**: Card showing active passive effects

**Why This System Works**: The physical act of flipping tokens as you take damage creates a visceral connection to the Martyr's theme of gaining power through suffering. Each token represents a wound endured, a sacrifice made, a step closer to divine transcendence. The vertical stack visually shows your growing power, and the decision to spend Devotion (flipping tokens back down) feels meaningful—you're literally giving up accumulated power for a critical moment. The system is simple enough to track mid-combat but deep enough to create strategic decisions about when to build and when to spend.

**Pro Tips**:
- **Intervene Early**: Use Intervene in first 3 turns to build Devotion fast
- **Communicate Levels**: Tell party when you reach Level 3+ (defensive auras)
- **Save Level 6**: Resistance aura is incredibly powerful, don't spend lightly
- **Track Passives**: Keep reference card visible so you don't forget bonuses
- **Amplification Timing**: Use big amplifications when they'll turn the tide
- **Specialization Synergy**: Redemption = healing focus, Zealot = damage focus, Ascetic = Devotion efficiency

**Budget-Friendly Alternatives**:
- **No tokens?** Use coins, buttons, or dice to mark levels
- **No damage counter?** Just write damage total on paper
- **No reference card?** Write passive effects on index card
- **Minimalist**: Track damage and level number only, reference passives as needed

**Specialization-Specific Tracking**:

**Redemption**:
- When you Intervene, heal protected ally for 2d6 HP
- Roll 2d6 and announce healing when using Intervene
- All healing spells have +10 ft range

**Zealot**:
- Deal +1d6 radiant damage per Devotion Level
- At Level 4, add 4d6 radiant to attacks
- Track radiant damage dice separately

**Ascetic**:
- Devotion thresholds reduced by 10 damage each
- Level 1 at 0 damage, Level 2 at 10, Level 3 at 30, etc.
- Reach high Devotion faster, adjust token flipping accordingly

**Why Martyr Is Perfect for In-Person Play**: The class is built around a simple, tangible resource (Devotion Levels) that directly correlates to damage taken—something already tracked in every TTRPG. The vertical token stack creates a visual representation of your growing power, and the dramatic moment of spending high Devotion for a massive amplified spell (removing multiple tokens at once) is incredibly satisfying. The passive effects are easy to remember and apply, and the Intervene mechanic creates heroic moments where you literally throw yourself in front of danger to protect allies. Every wound you bear is visible in your Devotion stack, making the Martyr's theme of "power through sacrifice" tangible and memorable.`
