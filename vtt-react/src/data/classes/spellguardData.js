    subtitle: 'Arcane Absorption Specialist',
    
    description: `The Spellguard is a magical tank who stands as a bulwark against enemy spellcasters. By absorbing and converting incoming magical damage into Arcane Energy Points (AEP), Spellguards transform enemy magic into their own power. They excel at disrupting enemy casters, protecting allies from magical threats, and turning the enemy's greatest strength into their greatest weakness.`,
    
    roleplayIdentity: {
      title: 'Roleplay Identity',
      content: `Spellguards are individuals who have learned to internalize and weaponize magical energy. Whether through rigorous training, natural affinity, or arcane experimentation, they possess the unique ability to absorb spells that would devastate others. They are the ultimate anti-mage specialists, feared by spellcasters and valued by allies.

**The Spellguard's Philosophy**: Magic is not inherently good or evil—it is energy, and energy can be redirected, absorbed, and repurposed. The greatest defense against magic is not resistance, but absorption and conversion.

**Common Archetypes**:
- **The Spell Eater**: A warrior who hungers for magical energy, actively seeking out enemy casters to drain
- **The Arcane Knight**: A disciplined protector trained in anti-magic combat techniques
- **The Mana Vampire**: One who feeds on magical energy, growing stronger with each spell absorbed
- **The Nullifier**: A zealot dedicated to suppressing and controlling dangerous magic
- **The Arcane Experiment**: A being transformed by magical experimentation, now able to metabolize spells
- **The Warden**: A guardian who shields others from magical threats through personal sacrifice

**Personality Traits**: Spellguards tend to be stoic, disciplined, and protective. They understand the dangers of unchecked magic and take their role as magical guardians seriously. Some are calm and methodical, while others are aggressive hunters of enemy casters. Many develop a sixth sense for detecting magical energy.

**Physical Manifestations**: A Spellguard's absorption abilities often manifest visibly—glowing runes that pulse when absorbing spells, an aura that seems to drink in magical light, or armor that shimmers with absorbed arcane energy. Their weapons and shields often bear anti-magic enchantments.`

      title: 'Combat Role',
      content: `**Primary Role**: Magical Tank / Anti-Mage Specialist

The Spellguard excels at absorbing magical damage and disrupting enemy spellcasters. They are the ultimate counter to magic-heavy enemy compositions, growing stronger as they absorb more spells.

**Damage Mitigation**: Exceptional against magical damage through absorption mechanics. Moderate against physical damage through standard tanking.

**Threat Generation**: Generates high threat against enemy casters through spell disruption, reflection, and mana drain abilities.

**Utility**: Provides magical protection for allies, counterspell capabilities, and anti-magic zone control.

**Strengths**:
- Exceptional defense against magical damage
- Grows stronger when facing multiple casters
- Can reflect spells back at enemies
- Disrupts enemy spellcasters effectively
- Provides magical shields for allies
- Drains enemy mana through melee attacks
- Converts enemy power into personal resources

**Weaknesses**:
- Less effective against physical damage dealers
- Requires enemy spellcasters to generate AEP
- Limited AEP generation in non-magical encounters
- Resource-dependent for most powerful abilities
- Can be overwhelmed by rapid spell barrages
- Vulnerable when AEP reserves are depleted

**Team Dynamics**:
- Essential against magic-heavy enemy compositions
- Protects squishy casters from enemy spells
- Synergizes with physical damage dealers who can handle non-casters
- Benefits from healers who can sustain through absorption damage
- Works well with crowd control to manage multiple casters`

    playstyle: {
      title: 'Playstyle & Strategy',
      content: `Playing a Spellguard is about positioning yourself to intercept enemy spells, managing your AEP reserves, and knowing when to absorb versus when to reflect.

**Core Gameplay Loop**:
1. **Position to Intercept** enemy spells targeting allies
2. **Absorb Magical Damage** to generate AEP
3. **Spend AEP** on shields, reflections, or offensive abilities
4. **Drain Mana** through melee attacks to weaken casters
5. **Protect Allies** with barriers and anti-magic zones

**AEP Management**:
- **Low AEP (0-15)**: Focus on absorption, conservative spending, basic shields
- **Medium AEP (16-40)**: Moderate spending on reflections and ally protection
- **High AEP (41-75)**: Aggressive spending, powerful barriers, offensive abilities
- **Maximum AEP (76-100)**: Ultimate abilities, mass protection, devastating counterattacks

**Positioning Strategy**:
- **Frontline Against Casters**: Stand between enemy casters and your allies
- **Spell Interception**: Position to intercept area spells before they reach allies
- **Mana Drain Range**: Stay in melee range of enemy casters to drain mana
- **Reflection Angles**: Position to reflect spells back at casters or into enemy groups

**When to Spend AEP**:
- **Emergency Shields**: Protect allies from devastating spells
- **Spell Reflection**: Turn powerful enemy spells against them
- **Offensive Bursts**: When you need to eliminate a priority caster
- **Mass Protection**: When facing multiple casters or area spells
- **Mana Denial**: Drain enemy casters to prevent future spells

**Specialization Strategies**:
- **Arcane Warden**: Maximum absorption, protect entire party, outlast enemy casters
- **Spell Breaker**: Aggressive reflection, punish enemy casters, disrupt spell rotations
- **Mana Reaver**: Offensive playstyle, drain and convert, eliminate casters quickly

**Advanced Techniques**:
- **Spell Baiting**: Intentionally draw enemy spells to build AEP
- **Reflection Timing**: Wait for high-value spells before using reflection abilities
- **AEP Banking**: Save AEP for critical moments rather than spending immediately
- **Mana Pressure**: Constantly drain enemy casters to limit their options
- **Zone Control**: Use anti-magic zones to deny areas to enemy casters`

    immersiveCombatExample: {
      title: 'Combat Example: The Spell Eater',
      content: `**The Setup**: You're a Spellguard (Arcane Warden specialization) facing a group of enemy mages (3 fire mages + 1 archmage). Your party is with you. Starting AEP: 0. Starting Mana: 40/50. Your goal: Absorb enemy spells to generate AEP, then use that AEP to protect allies and reflect spells back at enemies.

**Starting State**: AEP: 0/100 | Mana: 40/50 | HP: 70/70 | Shield: 0

**Turn 1 - First Absorption (AEP: 0 → 18)**

*Three fire mages and an archmage stand before you. They begin casting. Perfect. You HUNGER for their magic.*

**Fire Mage #1's Turn**: Casts Fireball at your party (targeting you and 2 allies)
**Fireball Damage**: 28 fire damage to all targets

**Your Reaction**: "Arcane Absorption" (passive ability, no cost)
**Effect**: You absorb the magical damage, converting it to AEP instead of HP damage

*The fireball SLAMS into you. But instead of burning, the flames are PULLED INTO YOUR BODY. Your armor glows with absorbed energy.*

**Damage Absorbed**: 28 fire damage → 0 HP damage taken
**AEP Generated**: 28 damage absorbed × 0.5 = **14 AEP**
**AEP**: 0 + 14 = **14/100**

**Your Allies**: Still take 28 fire damage each (you only absorbed your portion)

**Your Party's Mage**: "The fireball... you just ATE it!"
**You**: "Arcane Absorption. I convert magical damage to Arcane Energy Points. I have 14 AEP now."

**Fire Mage #2's Turn**: Casts Lightning Bolt at you
**Lightning Damage**: 22 lightning damage

**Your Reaction**: Arcane Absorption (passive)
**Damage Absorbed**: 22 lightning damage → 0 HP damage taken
**AEP Generated**: 22 × 0.5 = **11 AEP**
**AEP**: 14 + 11 = **25/100**

*Lightning CRASHES into you. Your body DRINKS IT IN. Your eyes glow with crackling energy.*

**Your Action**: Melee attack Fire Mage #1 (no mana cost)
**Attack Roll**: d20+5 → [16] = Hit!
**Damage**: 2d8+3 → [7, 6] + 3 = **16 damage**
**Mana Drain**: Fire Mage #1 loses 1d4 → [3] = 3 mana

*Your weapon PULSES with anti-magic energy. When it strikes, it DRAINS the mage's mana.*

**Fire Mage #1**: Takes 16 damage, loses 3 mana

**Current State**: AEP: 25/100 | Mana: 40/50 | HP: 70/70

**Turn 2 - Building Power (AEP: 25 → 53)**

*The archmage begins casting. You can feel the power building. This will be a BIG spell.*

**Archmage's Turn**: Casts "Meteor Swarm" at your party (massive AoE)
**Meteor Damage**: 45 fire damage to all party members

**Your Reaction**: "Spell Interception" (10 AEP, intercept spell targeting ally)
**Effect**: You jump in front of your healer, taking their portion of the damage

*You LEAP in front of your healer. The meteor SLAMS into you instead of them.*

**Damage Absorbed**: 45 (your portion) + 45 (healer's portion) = **90 fire damage total**
**Arcane Absorption**: 90 damage → 0 HP damage taken
**AEP Generated**: 90 × 0.5 = **45 AEP**
**AEP**: 25 - 10 (Spell Interception cost) + 45 (absorption) = **60/100**

**Your Party's Healer**: "You... you saved me! You took the entire meteor!"
**You**: "Spell Interception. Cost me 10 AEP, but I absorbed 90 damage and gained 45 AEP. Net gain: 35 AEP. I'm at 60 AEP now."

**Fire Mage #3's Turn**: Casts Fireball at you
**Fireball Damage**: 26 fire damage

**Arcane Absorption**: 26 damage → 0 HP damage taken
**AEP Generated**: 26 × 0.5 = **13 AEP**
**AEP**: 60 + 13 = **73/100**

*Another fireball. Another meal. Your armor is BLAZING with absorbed magical energy.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Arcane Shield" on your mage (15 AEP)
**Effect**: Target ally gains shield absorbing 30 magical damage

**AEP**: 73 - 15 = **58/100**

*You gesture at your mage. A shimmering barrier of absorbed arcane energy surrounds them.*

**Your Party's Mage**: "I feel... protected. What is this?"
**You**: "Arcane Shield. Spent 15 AEP to give you a 30-damage shield against magic. You're safe now."

**Current State**: AEP: 58/100 | Mana: 40/50 | HP: 70/70

**Turn 3 - Spell Reflection (AEP: 58 → 71)**

*The enemy mages are starting to realize their spells are feeding you. But they have no choice—they're casters. Magic is all they have.*

**Fire Mage #1's Turn**: Casts Fireball at you
**Fireball Damage**: 30 fire damage

**Your Reaction**: "Spell Reflection" (25 AEP, reflect spell back at caster)
**Effect**: The fireball is REFLECTED back at Fire Mage #1

*You raise your hand. The fireball STOPS in mid-air, hovering. Then it REVERSES, flying back at the caster.*

**AEP**: 58 - 25 = **33/100**

**Fire Mage #1**: Takes 30 fire damage from his own Fireball → **DEAD**

**Your Party's Rogue**: "You just... threw his spell back at him!"
**You**: "Spell Reflection. Cost 25 AEP. His own fireball killed him."

**Archmage's Turn**: Casts "Chain Lightning" at your party
**Lightning Damage**: 35 lightning damage, chains to 3 targets

**Your Reaction**: Arcane Absorption (you're one of the targets)
**Damage Absorbed**: 35 lightning damage → 0 HP damage taken
**AEP Generated**: 35 × 0.5 = **17 AEP**
**AEP**: 33 + 17 = **50/100**

**Your Allies**: Take 35 lightning damage each (but your mage's Arcane Shield absorbs it)
**Mage's Shield**: 30/30 → 0/30 (absorbed 30 damage, took 5 HP damage)

**Your Action**: Melee attack Archmage (no mana cost)
**Attack Roll**: d20+5 → [18] = Hit!
**Damage**: 2d8+3 → [8, 7] + 3 = **18 damage**
**Mana Drain**: Archmage loses 1d4 → [4] = 4 mana

*You close the distance and strike. Your weapon DRAINS the archmage's mana.*

**Archmage**: Takes 18 damage, loses 4 mana

**Fire Mage #2's Turn**: Casts Fireball at you
**Fireball Damage**: 28 fire damage

**Arcane Absorption**: 28 damage → 0 HP damage taken
**AEP Generated**: 28 × 0.5 = **14 AEP**
**AEP**: 50 + 14 = **64/100**

**Current State**: AEP: 64/100 | Mana: 40/50 | HP: 70/70

**Turn 4 - Maximum Absorption (AEP: 64 → 85)**

*You're at 64 AEP. The enemy mages are running low on mana from your drains. Time to finish this.*

**Your Action**: Cast "Anti-Magic Zone" (20 mana, creates 15 ft zone)
**Effect**: All spells cast in zone have disadvantage on attack rolls, spell save DCs reduced by 2

**Mana**: 40 - 20 = 20/50

*You slam your weapon into the ground. A ZONE of anti-magic energy spreads outward, suppressing magical power.*

**Fire Mage #2**: Tries to cast Fireball (inside zone)
**Spell Save DC**: 15 → 13 (reduced by 2)
**Your Party**: Easier to save against the spell

**Archmage's Turn**: Casts "Disintegrate" at you (single-target, massive damage)
**Disintegrate Damage**: 75 force damage

**Your Reaction**: Arcane Absorption
**Damage Absorbed**: 75 force damage → 0 HP damage taken
**AEP Generated**: 75 × 0.5 = **37 AEP**
**AEP**: 64 + 37 = **101/100** → Capped at **100/100** (MAXIMUM AEP)

*The disintegration ray SLAMS into you. Your body DEVOURS it. You are at MAXIMUM ARCANE ENERGY.*

**You**: "MAXIMUM AEP. I've absorbed everything they've thrown at me. Now I unleash it."

**Your Action (1 AP)**: "Arcane Detonation" (50 AEP, massive AoE damage)
**Effect**: Release absorbed energy in 20 ft radius explosion
**Damage**: 50 force damage to all enemies in radius

**AEP**: 100 - 50 = **50/100**

*You EXPLODE with absorbed magical energy. A shockwave of pure arcane force ERUPTS from your body.*

**Fire Mage #2**: Takes 50 force damage → **DEAD**
**Fire Mage #3**: Takes 50 force damage → **DEAD**
**Archmage**: Takes 50 force damage → HEAVILY DAMAGED (near death)

**Your Party's Tank**: "You just... exploded with their own magic!"
**You**: "Arcane Detonation. I spent 50 AEP to release all the energy I absorbed. That was THEIR magic, turned against them."

**Current State**: AEP: 50/100 | Mana: 20/50 | HP: 70/70

**Turn 5 - Finishing the Archmage**

*Only the archmage remains, heavily damaged and low on mana from your drains.*

**Archmage's Turn**: Casts "Magic Missile" at you (desperate, low mana)
**Magic Missile Damage**: 3d4+3 → [3, 4, 2] + 3 = **12 force damage**

**Arcane Absorption**: 12 damage → 0 HP damage taken
**AEP Generated**: 12 × 0.5 = **6 AEP**
**AEP**: 50 + 6 = **56/100**

**Your Action**: Melee attack Archmage
**Attack Roll**: d20+5 → [19] = Hit!
**Damage**: 2d8+3 → [8, 6] + 3 = **17 damage**
**Mana Drain**: Archmage loses 1d4 → [3] = 3 mana

**Archmage**: Takes 17 damage → **DEAD**

**Combat Over**

*You stand among the fallen mages, your armor still glowing with absorbed arcane energy. You took ZERO damage.*

**Your Party's Healer**: "You didn't take a single point of damage. They hit you with fireballs, lightning, meteors, disintegration rays... and you absorbed EVERYTHING."
**You**: "Arcane Absorption. Every point of magical damage I take is converted to AEP instead of HP damage. I absorbed 90 damage from the meteor, 75 from disintegrate, and multiple fireballs and lightning bolts. Total: over 300 damage absorbed."
**Your Party's Mage**: "And you used that energy to protect us and kill them?"
**You**: "Exactly. I spent 15 AEP to shield you. I spent 25 AEP to reflect a fireball back at a mage, killing him with his own spell. I spent 50 AEP on Arcane Detonation, killing two mages with their own absorbed energy."
**Your Party's Tank**: "And the mana drains?"
**You**: "Every melee attack drains 1d4 mana from enemy casters. I drained the archmage for 4, 3, and 3 mana across three hits. That's 10 mana stolen, limiting his spell options."

**Final State**: AEP: 56/100 | Mana: 20/50 | HP: 70/70 (full health, zero damage taken)

**The Lesson**: Spellguard gameplay is about:
1. **Arcane Absorption**: Converted 300+ magical damage to 0 HP damage, generated 100+ AEP
2. **Spell Interception**: Jumped in front of healer, absorbed their meteor damage (90 damage)
3. **Spell Reflection**: Reflected fireball back at caster for 30 damage, killing them with their own spell
4. **Arcane Shield**: Spent 15 AEP to protect ally with 30-damage shield
5. **Arcane Detonation**: Spent 50 AEP to deal 50 AoE damage, killing 2 mages
6. **Mana Drain**: Drained 10+ mana from archmage through melee attacks
7. **AEP Management**: Built from 0 → 100 (max) → 50 (after detonation) → 56 (final)

You're the ultimate ANTI-MAGE TANK. Enemy spells don't hurt you—they FEED you. Every fireball, every lightning bolt, every meteor is FUEL for your abilities. You absorbed a 75-damage disintegration ray and took ZERO damage. You intercepted a meteor to save your healer. You reflected a fireball back at its caster. You detonated 50 AEP of absorbed energy, killing two mages with their own magic. Against spellcasters, you're INVINCIBLE. You're not just a tank—you're a SPELL EATER.`

    description: `The Spellguard's power stems from their ability to absorb magical damage and convert it into Arcane Energy Points (AEP). Each point of magical damage absorbed generates AEP, which can then be spent on powerful defensive and offensive abilities. Mastering AEP management is the key to becoming an effective Spellguard.`,
    
    mechanics: {
      title: 'How It Works',
      content: `**Generating AEP**:
- **Absorb Elements (Passive)**: Automatically absorb fire, cold, lightning, or necrotic damage. Gain 2 AEP for every point of magical damage taken.
- **Energy Conversion (Passive)**: Convert physical damage into AEP. Gain 1 AEP for every 2 points of physical damage taken.
- **Mana Drain (Passive)**: When you hit with a melee attack, drain mana from the target equal to the damage dealt. Gain 1 AEP per mana drained.

**Maximum AEP**: You can hold up to 100 AEP at once. Excess AEP is lost.

**AEP Persistence**: AEP persists between combats but decays at a rate of 5 AEP per minute outside of combat.

**Spending AEP**: AEP can be spent on various abilities including shields, reflections, strikes, healing, and utility effects. Most abilities cost both mana and AEP.

**Strategic Considerations**:
- AEP generation is highest when facing multiple casters or in magical-heavy encounters
- Balance absorption (taking damage to generate AEP) with survival (using AEP for shields)
- Save AEP for critical moments rather than spending immediately
- Mana drain provides consistent AEP generation even against non-casters
- Different specializations have different AEP generation and spending patterns`

- Prioritize high-efficiency abilities (10-15 AEP cost) for consistent value
- Save expensive abilities (20-25 AEP) for critical moments
- Balance AEP generation (taking damage) with survival (spending on shields)
- Against multiple casters, focus on absorption to rapidly build AEP
- Against single casters, use mana drain to generate steady AEP

**Specialization Synergies**:
- **Arcane Warden**: Maximize AEP generation through enhanced absorption, spend on ally protection
- **Spell Breaker**: Generate bonus AEP through reflections, spend on disruption and counterattacks
- **Mana Reaver**: Generate AEP through aggressive mana drain, spend on offensive abilities

**Combat Pacing**:
- Early Combat: Build AEP through absorption and mana drain
- Mid Combat: Spend AEP on shields and reflections as needed
- Late Combat: Use accumulated AEP for finishing moves or emergency protection

**Team Coordination**:
- Communicate AEP levels to allies so they know when you can shield them
- Position to intercept spells targeting vulnerable allies
- Use anti-magic zones to protect key areas during critical moments`

    playingInPerson: {
      title: 'Playing Spellguard In Person',
      content: `**Required Materials**:
- **AEP Counter** (d100, tokens, or beads representing Arcane Energy Points)
- **Damage Tracker** (for tracking magical damage absorbed)
- **AEP Conversion Chart** (showing damage → AEP conversion rates)
- **Shield Status Cards** (showing active shields and their HP)
- **Ability Cost Reference** (showing AEP costs for abilities)
- **Specialization Card** (showing passive bonuses and AEP multipliers)

**Primary Tracking Method: AEP Counter + Damage Conversion**

The Spellguard's resource system converts absorbed magical damage into Arcane Energy Points (AEP), which can then be spent on shields, reflections, and abilities. The key is tracking damage taken and converting it to AEP using simple math.

**Setup**:
\`\`\`
SPELLGUARD RESOURCE TRACKING:

ARCANE ENERGY POINTS (AEP): [___] / 100

AEP GENERATION:
• Magical damage (fire/cold/lightning/necrotic): 2 AEP per damage
• Physical damage: 1 AEP per 2 damage
• Mana drain (melee hit): 1 AEP per mana drained
• Arcane Warden spec: 3 AEP per magical damage (1.5x)
• Spell Breaker spec: +5 AEP per successful reflection

AEP SPENDING:
• Arcane Shield (10 AEP): +2 armor, absorbs 20 damage
• Spell Reflection (15 AEP): Reflect spell back at caster
• Barrier of Protection (20 AEP): Shield ally for 30 damage
• Anti-Magic Zone (30 AEP): 15 ft zone, spells cost +5 mana
• Mana Drain Strike (5 AEP): Melee attack drains 1d6 mana
\`\`\`

**How It Works**:

**AEP Generation (Absorbing Damage)**:
1. **Take magical damage** → Convert to AEP at 2:1 ratio
2. **Take physical damage** → Convert to AEP at 1:2 ratio (half as efficient)
3. **Drain mana** → Convert to AEP at 1:1 ratio
4. **Add AEP** to your counter

**AEP Spending (Using Abilities)**:
1. **Choose ability** → Check AEP cost
2. **Subtract AEP** from your counter
3. **Activate ability** → Apply effects

**Example Combat Turn**:

*You have 25 AEP, enemy mage casts Fireball at you*

**Enemy Mage's Turn**:
1. "The mage casts Fireball at you!"
2. Fireball damage: 8d6 → [6,5,4,6,3,5,4,6] = 39 fire damage
3. You take 39 fire damage (magical)

**Your AEP Generation**:
1. Magical damage taken: 39 damage
2. Conversion rate: 2 AEP per damage
3. AEP gained: 39 × 2 = **78 AEP**
4. Total AEP: 25 + 78 = **103 AEP**

**Your Turn - Spend AEP**:
1. "I activate Arcane Shield!" (10 AEP)
2. AEP: 103 - 10 = **93 AEP**
3. Shield active: +2 armor, absorbs 20 damage
4. "I cast Spell Reflection!" (15 AEP)
5. AEP: 93 - 15 = **78 AEP**
6. Ready to reflect next spell

**Example AEP Conversion**:

*You're an Arcane Warden (1.5x magical damage AEP)*

**Turn 1 - Lightning Bolt**:
1. Enemy casts Lightning Bolt → 6d6 → [5,6,4,5,3,6] = 29 lightning damage
2. Base AEP: 29 × 2 = 58 AEP
3. Arcane Warden bonus: 58 × 1.5 = **87 AEP** (rounded from 87)
4. Total AEP: 0 + 87 = **87 AEP**

**Turn 2 - Physical Attack**:
1. Enemy warrior attacks → 2d8+5 → [7,6] + 5 = 18 physical damage
2. Physical conversion: 18 ÷ 2 = **9 AEP**
3. Total AEP: 87 + 9 = **96 AEP**

**Turn 3 - Mana Drain**:
1. You hit enemy mage with melee attack → 1d8+3 → [6] + 3 = 9 damage
2. Mana drained: 9 mana
3. AEP gained: 9 × 1 = **9 AEP**
4. Total AEP: 96 + 9 = **105 AEP** (capped at 100)
5. Final AEP: **100 AEP** (max)

**Example In-Person Turn**:

*You have 40 AEP, enemy mage targets your ally with Ice Storm*

**Enemy Mage's Turn**:
1. "The mage casts Ice Storm at your ally!"
2. Ice Storm damage: 4d8 → [7,6,5,8] = 26 cold damage

**Your Reaction - Barrier of Protection**:
1. "I cast Barrier of Protection on my ally!" (20 AEP)
2. AEP: 40 - 20 = **20 AEP**
3. Barrier absorbs 30 damage
4. Ally takes: 26 - 30 = **0 damage** (barrier absorbs all)
5. Barrier HP remaining: 30 - 26 = **4 HP**

**Next Turn - Enemy Attacks You**:
1. Enemy casts Fireball at you → 8d6 → [6,5,4,6,3,5,4,6] = 39 fire damage
2. You take 39 fire damage
3. AEP gained: 39 × 2 = **78 AEP**
4. Total AEP: 20 + 78 = **98 AEP**

**Your Turn - Spell Reflection**:
1. "I prepare Spell Reflection!" (15 AEP)
2. AEP: 98 - 15 = **83 AEP**
3. Ready to reflect next spell targeting you

**Alternative Tracking Methods**:

**Method 1: Token System**
- Use poker chips or tokens (1 token = 10 AEP)
- Add tokens when you absorb damage
- Remove tokens when you spend AEP
- Visual and tactile

**Method 2: D100 Die**
- Rotate die to show current AEP
- Quick and easy to adjust
- Single die tracks everything

**Method 3: Bead Counter**
- Use beads on a string or abacus
- Move beads to track AEP
- Satisfying physical feedback

**Method 4: Paper Tracking**
- Write AEP on paper
- Cross out and rewrite as it changes
- Minimalist approach

SPELLGUARD QUICK REFERENCE

AEP GENERATION:
• Magical damage: 2 AEP per damage (3 for Arcane Warden)
• Physical damage: 1 AEP per 2 damage
• Mana drain: 1 AEP per mana
• Spell reflection: +5 AEP (Spell Breaker spec)

AEP SPENDING:
• Arcane Shield: 10 AEP (+2 armor, 20 absorb)
• Spell Reflection: 15 AEP (reflect spell)
• Barrier of Protection: 20 AEP (shield ally, 30 absorb)
• Anti-Magic Zone: 30 AEP (15 ft, +5 mana cost)
• Mana Drain Strike: 5 AEP (drain 1d6 mana)

STRATEGY:
• Tank magical damage to build AEP
• Spend on shields for allies or reflections
• Save 30+ AEP for Anti-Magic Zone
• Arcane Warden: Focus on absorption
• Spell Breaker: Focus on reflections
• Mana Reaver: Focus on mana drain
\`\`\`

**Thematic Enhancements**:

Many players enhance the Spellguard experience with:
- **Blue Dice**: Use blue dice for AEP tracking (arcane theme)
- **Shield Tokens**: Physical tokens representing active shields
- **Damage Crystals**: Blue crystals representing absorbed magical energy
- **AEP Beads**: String of beads for tracking AEP visually
- **Reflection Mirror**: Small mirror prop for spell reflections
- **Glow Effect**: LED tea light that glows when shields are active

**AEP Management Tips**:

**Generation Strategy**:
- **Tank Spells**: Position to intercept spells targeting allies
- **Maximize Absorption**: Take magical damage over physical when possible
- **Mana Drain**: Use melee attacks to generate AEP consistently
- **Arcane Warden**: Seek out magical damage sources
- **Spell Breaker**: Reflect spells for bonus AEP

**Spending Strategy**:
- **Emergency Shields**: Keep 20 AEP for Barrier of Protection
- **Reflection Ready**: Keep 15 AEP for Spell Reflection
- **Zone Control**: Save 30 AEP for Anti-Magic Zone in boss fights
- **Don't Cap**: Spend AEP before hitting 100 cap
- **Prioritize Allies**: Shield allies over yourself when possible

**Specialization Strategy**:
- **Arcane Warden**: Generate maximum AEP, spend on ally shields
- **Spell Breaker**: Reflect aggressively for bonus AEP and damage
- **Mana Reaver**: Drain mana constantly, spend on offensive abilities

**Why This System Works**: The AEP conversion system is simple math (damage × 2 for magical, damage ÷ 2 for physical) that creates a satisfying feedback loop. Taking damage feels GOOD because it generates resources. The physical act of adding tokens or rotating a die when you absorb a Fireball creates positive reinforcement. The spending decisions (shield myself vs shield ally vs reflect spell) create meaningful tactical choices. The system rewards aggressive positioning and tanking spells, making you feel like a true magical tank.

**Pro Tips**:
- **Quick Math**: Round AEP conversions for speed (39 damage → 80 AEP instead of 78)
- **Pre-Calculate**: Know common spell damages and their AEP values
- **Communicate**: Tell allies your AEP so they know when you can shield them
- **Track Shields**: Use separate tokens for active shield HP
- **Mana Drain**: Melee attacks are consistent AEP generation
- **Cap Awareness**: Don't waste absorption when at 100 AEP

**Budget-Friendly Alternatives**:
- **No tokens?** Use coins (pennies = 1 AEP, dimes = 10 AEP)
- **No d100?** Write AEP on paper
- **No shield cards?** Track shield HP on paper
- **Minimalist**: Just track AEP number on paper, reference costs

**Specialization-Specific Tracking**:

**Arcane Warden**:
- Track 3 AEP per magical damage (instead of 2)
- Mark when shields are active (+2 AC, +10% resistances)
- Track shield duration (50% longer)

**Spell Breaker**:
- Track +5 AEP bonus per reflection
- Mark reflected spells (+25% damage)
- Track reflection cooldown reduction

**Mana Reaver**:
- Track mana drained (enhanced on melee)
- Convert AEP to damage (offensive abilities)
- Track burst damage windows

**Why Spellguard Is Perfect for In-Person Play**: The class is built around simple math (damage → AEP conversion) that creates satisfying resource generation. Taking damage feels GOOD because it generates AEP, creating a unique psychological reward. The physical act of adding tokens or rotating a die when you absorb a Fireball is deeply satisfying. The spending decisions are clear and impactful—do I shield myself, shield my ally, or reflect the next spell? The system rewards aggressive positioning and tanking spells, making you feel like a true magical tank. Every spell that hits you makes you stronger, and that power fantasy translates perfectly to tabletop play.`
