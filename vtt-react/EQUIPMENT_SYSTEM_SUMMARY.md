const currency = calculateStartingCurrency('noble', 'trickster');
// Result: { platinum: 0, gold: 60, silver: 0, copper: 0 }

// Get available items
const characterData = {
    class: 'Pyrofiend',
    race: 'human',
    subrace: null,
    path: 'mystic',
    background: 'sage'
};

const availableItems = getAvailableStartingItems(characterData);
// Returns: Universal items + Pyrofiend items + Human items + Mystic items + Sage items

const itemsByCategory = getItemsByCategory(characterData);
// Returns: { weapons: [...], armor: [...], accessories: [...], ... }
```

## 🎮 How It Works (Player Experience)

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **Player creates character** through steps 1-8 (Basic Info → Lore Details)
2. **Equipment Selection Step appears** (Step 9)
3. **Starting currency is calculated** based on:
   - Background choice (8-50 gold base)
   - Path choice (+2-10 gold bonus)
   - Example: Noble + Trickster = 60 gold total
4. **Available items are filtered** based on:
   - Character's class (only see class-appropriate items)
   - Character's race/subrace (racial items appear)
   - Character's path (path-specific items appear)
   - Character's background (background items appear)
   - Universal items (always available)
5. **Player shops for equipment**:
   - Browse by category or search
   - Hover to see full item details
   - Click to purchase (if affordable)
   - Click X to refund and get money back
6. **Currency updates in real-time**
7. **Player proceeds to Summary** (Step 10) to finalize character

### Visual Features:

- **Quality-based borders**: Common (gray), Uncommon (green), Rare (blue), Epic (purple), Legendary (orange)
- **WoW-style icons**: All items use authentic WoW icon images
- **Pathfinder aesthetic**: Beige parchment background with golden accents
