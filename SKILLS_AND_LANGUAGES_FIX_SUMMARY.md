# Skills and Languages Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Path Skills Now Granted Automatically ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Path selections (like Mystic, Mercenary, etc.) have `skillProficiencies` but these weren't being automatically granted in Step 7.

**Solution**: 
- Added path skill proficiencies to the granted skills list
- Combined background + path skills into a single `grantedSkills` array
- Removed duplicates using `Set` in case background and path grant the same skill

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: Only background skills were granted
const backgroundSkills = backgroundSkillsDnD
    .map(dndSkill => DND_TO_CUSTOM_SKILL_MAP[dndSkill])
    .filter(Boolean);

// After: Both background AND path skills are granted
const pathSkillsDnD = pathData?.skillProficiencies || [];
const pathSkills = pathSkillsDnD
    .map(dndSkill => DND_TO_CUSTOM_SKILL_MAP[dndSkill])
    .filter(Boolean);

const grantedSkills = [...new Set([...backgroundSkills, ...pathSkills])];
```

### 2. Languages Still Work Correctly ‚úÖ

**Languages are calculated from**:
- **Racial Languages**: Automatically granted from race/subrace (shown in "Racial Languages" section)
- **Additional Languages**: `(backgroundData.languages || 0) + (pathData.languages || 0)`

**Example**:
- **Acolyte Background**: 2 languages
- **Mystic Path**: 2 languages
- **Total**: 4 additional languages to choose

**Language Selection**:
- Racial languages are shown separately and cannot be deselected
- Additional languages can be chosen from the full list (excluding racial ones)
- Selection counter shows: "2 / 4 Selected" (for example)

### 3. Skill Selection Count Matches Loadout ‚úÖ

**Skills are granted/selected as follows**:

#### Automatically Granted (Cannot Deselect):
- **Background Skills**: 2-3 skills depending on background
  - Acolyte: Insight, Religion
  - Criminal: Deception, Stealth
  - Sage: Arcana, History
  - etc.
- **Path Skills**: 3 skills depending on path
  - Mystic: Arcana, Insight, Religion
  - Mercenary: Athletics, Intimidation, Persuasion
  - etc.

**Note**: If background and path grant the same skill, it only appears once (no duplicates)

#### Player Chooses:
- **Class Skills**: 2 additional skills from the full list of 32 skills

**Total Skills**: Typically 5-7 skills (depending on overlap between background and path)

### 4. UI Updates ‚úÖ

**Granted Skills Display**:
```
üéÅ Granted Skills: Arcana, Insight, Religion (2 from background, 3 from path)
```

**Skill Selection Counter**:
```
‚öôÔ∏è Skill Proficiencies
2 / 2 Selected
```

**Language Selection Counter**:
```
üåê Languages
4 / 4 Selected
```
