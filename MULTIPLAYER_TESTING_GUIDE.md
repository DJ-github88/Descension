# 🧪 Multiplayer Testing Guide - Critical Fixes

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### ✅ Player Count Issue
- **Problem**: Showing 3 players when only 2 were connected
- **Fix**: Removed incorrect +1 calculation in player count display
- **Expected**: Now shows accurate player count

### ✅ Token Synchronization
- **Problem**: Tokens created by one player replaced existing tokens instead of being additive
- **Fix**: Added duplicate prevention logic and proper event filtering
- **Expected**: All tokens now appear for all players without replacing each other

### ✅ Item Drop Synchronization  
- **Problem**: Items dropped by one player didn't appear for others immediately
- **Fix**: Improved event broadcasting and duplicate prevention
- **Expected**: Items appear immediately on all clients when dropped

### ✅ Event Duplication
- **Problem**: Players received their own events causing duplicates
- **Fix**: Added currentPlayer ID filtering to ignore own events
- **Expected**: No more duplicate tokens/items/movements

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Player Count Test
1. Open windtunnel.netlify.app in **2 browser windows**
2. Create room in window 1
3. Join room from window 2
4. **Check**: Player count should show "2 players" (not 3)
5. **Check**: Both players should appear in party/HUD

### 2. Token Creation Test
1. In window 1: Go to Creature Library → Create a token (e.g., Goblin)
2. In window 2: Go to Creature Library → Create a different token (e.g., Orc)
3. **Expected**: Both tokens should appear on both screens
4. **Expected**: No tokens should disappear or be replaced
5. **Expected**: Chat should show creation notifications

### 3. Token Movement Test
1. In window 1: Drag a token to a new position
2. **Expected**: Token should move smoothly on both screens
3. In window 2: Drag a different token
4. **Expected**: Both movements should be visible to both players

### 4. Item Drop Test
1. In window 1: Open inventory → Drag an item to the grid
2. **Expected**: Item should appear immediately on both screens
3. In window 2: Drop a different item
4. **Expected**: Both items should be visible to both players

### 5. Chat Color Test
1. Create room with a custom color (e.g., red)
2. Join from second window with different color (e.g., blue)
3. Send messages from both windows
4. **Expected**: Messages should display in the correct player colors

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Browser Console Logs to Watch For:
```
🌐 Multiplayer Environment Check:
🎮 Current Player: [PlayerName] ID: [PlayerID]
🎮 Connected Players: [List of players with IDs]
🎭 Token created by player: [PlayerName]
🎭 Ignoring own token creation to avoid duplicate
📦 Item dropped by player: [PlayerName]
📦 Ignoring own item drop to avoid duplicate
```

### What Should NOT Appear:
- "3 players" when only 2 are connected
- Duplicate tokens appearing
- Missing tokens on other players' screens
- Items not appearing when dropped
- Chat messages with wrong colors

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

### Check These:
1. **Browser Console**: Look for error messages
2. **Network Tab**: Check if WebSocket connection is established
3. **Railway Server**: Ensure server is running at descension-production.up.railway.app
4. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh both browser windows (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Common Issues:
- **Still seeing 3 players**: Clear browser cache and refresh
- **Tokens not syncing**: Check console for WebSocket connection errors
- **Items not appearing**: Verify both players are in the same room
- **Wrong colors**: Check if player colors were set during room creation/joining

## ✅ Success Criteria

The multiplayer system is working correctly when:
- [ ] Player count shows exactly the number of connected players
- [ ] All tokens created appear on all players' screens
- [ ] Token movements sync smoothly between players
- [ ] Items dropped appear immediately for all players
- [ ] Chat messages display in correct player colors
- [ ] No duplicate notifications or events
- [ ] Console shows proper debug information

## 🎉 Expected Results

After these fixes, your multiplayer VTT should provide:
- **Accurate player tracking**
- **Real-time token synchronization**
- **Immediate item drop visibility**
- **Proper event deduplication**
- **Smooth multiplayer experience**

Test thoroughly with multiple browser windows to verify all functionality works as expected!
