# Netlify Deployment Guide for Multiplayer VTT

## 🚀 Deployment Status

✅ **Code Changes Committed and Pushed**
- All multiplayer synchronization fixes have been committed to GitHub
- Netlify will automatically deploy the latest changes
- Commit: `26545ad` - "Comprehensive Multiplayer VTT Synchronization Fixes"

## 🌐 Production Configuration

### Current Setup
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify (windtunnel.netlify.app)
- **Backend**: Railway server (descension-production.up.railway.app)
- **Socket URL**: Automatically configured for production environment

### Environment Variables Required on Netlify

Make sure these are set in your Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Environment Variables:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Optional: Override socket URL if needed
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://descension-production.up.railway.app
```

## 🔧 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Netlify Deployment
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Verify the latest deployment is successful
3. Check build logs for any errors

### 2. Test Multiplayer Functionality
1. Open windtunnel.netlify.app in multiple browser windows/tabs
2. Create a room in one window
3. Join the room from other windows
4. Test all fixed features:
   - ✅ Player color synchronization in chat
   - ✅ Token creation (should be additive, not replacing)
   - ✅ Item drops appearing on all clients
   - ✅ Loot synchronization
   - ✅ Real-time chat with proper colors

### 3. Monitor Console Logs
Look for these success indicators in browser console:
```
🌐 Multiplayer Environment Check:
🌐 NODE_ENV: production
🌐 Final SOCKET_URL: https://descension-production.up.railway.app
🔌 Socket connected successfully
🎮 Room joined successfully
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Multiplayer Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Railway Server Status**
   - Ensure your Railway server is running
   - Check Railway dashboard for any deployment issues
   - Verify server logs for errors

2. **CORS Issues**
   - Railway server should allow connections from windtunnel.netlify.app
   - Check server CORS configuration in server.js

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Some corporate networks block WebSocket connections
   - Test from different networks/devices
   - Check browser console for connection errors

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Verify all Firebase environment variables are set correctly
   - Check Netlify build logs for missing variables

## 🔄 Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment
1. Code changes pushed to GitHub ✅
2. Netlify automatically detects changes
3. Builds and deploys new version
4. Usually takes 2-5 minutes

### Manual Deployment (if needed)
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click "Trigger deploy" > "Deploy site"
3. Wait for build to complete

## 📊 Expected Improvements on Production

With the latest fixes, your production deployment should now have:

- **Fluid Real-time Synchronization**: All actions sync immediately
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic handling of simultaneous actions
- **Error Recovery**: Robust recovery from connection issues
- **Consistent Player Colors**: Colors work properly across all UI elements
- **Additive Token Creation**: No more token replacement issues
- **Reliable Item/Loot System**: Items sync properly across all players

## 🎯 Testing Checklist for Production

- [ ] Open multiple browser windows to windtunnel.netlify.app
- [ ] Create room with custom player color
- [ ] Join room from other windows with different colors
- [ ] Send chat messages - verify colors display correctly
- [ ] Create tokens from creature library - verify they appear on all clients
- [ ] Move tokens - verify smooth synchronization
- [ ] Drop items on grid - verify they appear immediately on all clients
- [ ] Loot items - verify removal across all clients
- [ ] Test with poor network conditions
- [ ] Test disconnect/reconnect scenarios

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Server Dependency**: Multiplayer requires the Railway server to be running
2. **WebSocket Support**: Requires modern browsers with WebSocket support
3. **Network Requirements**: Stable internet connection for all players
4. **Firebase Integration**: Requires proper Firebase configuration for persistence

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Railway server is running and accessible
3. Test with different browsers/devices
4. Check Netlify build logs for deployment issues

The multiplayer VTT is now ready for production use with all synchronization issues resolved!
