# All Fixes Complete ✅

## Summary of All Changes

### 1. ✅ Combat Timeline Not Showing
**Problem**: CombatTimeline component wasn't being rendered in App.jsx or MultiplayerApp.jsx

**Fix**:
- Added `import CombatTimeline` to both files
- Added `<CombatTimeline />` component to render tree
- **Files**: `vtt-react/src/App.jsx`, `vtt-react/src/components/multiplayer/MultiplayerApp.jsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Movement Visualization Outside Combat
**Problem**: Stippled drag line only showed during combat

**Fix**:
- Removed `isInCombat` check from movement visualization start
- Changed from `if (showMovementVisualization && isInCombat)` to `if (showMovementVisualization)`
- **File**: `vtt-react/src/components/grid/CreatureToken.jsx` (Line 203)

---

### 3. ✅ Character/Player Token Selection for Combat
**Problem**: Character tokens couldn't be selected for combat

**Fix**:
- Added combat store imports: `isSelectionMode`, `selectedTokens`, `toggleTokenSelection`
- Added `isSelectedForCombat` state check
- Added click handler to toggle selection when in selection mode
- Added visual styling (green border/glow) for selected tokens
- Updated cursor to show pointer in selection mode
- **File**: `vtt-react/src/components/grid/CharacterToken.jsx`

### 4. ✅ Movement AP Cost System
**Current Behavior** (Already Working Correctly):

The system already implements the requested behavior:

1. **First Movement**: Costs 1 AP, unlocks creature's speed in feet (e.g., 30 ft)
2. **Within Unlocked Movement**: No prompts, free movement
3. **Exceeding Unlocked Movement**: Prompts for additional AP

**Example with 30 ft speed**:
- Move 25 ft → Costs 1 AP, unlocks 30 ft, 5 ft remaining free
- Move another 5 ft → Free (within unlocked 30 ft)
- Move another 10 ft → Prompts for 1 more AP (total 35 ft used, need 60 ft unlocked)
- Move 100 ft → Costs 4 AP total (30+30+30+10 = 100 ft)

**How It Works**:
```javascript
// First movement of turn
if (!hasUnlockedMovement || movementUsedThisTurn === 0) {
    additionalAPNeeded = 1;
    needsConfirmation = true;
}
// Subsequent movements
else if (totalMovementAfterThis > totalUnlockedMovement) {
    const excessMovement = totalMovementAfterThis - totalUnlockedMovement;
    const additionalSegments = Math.ceil(excessMovement / creatureSpeed);
    additionalAPNeeded = additionalSegments;
    needsConfirmation = true;
}
```

**Key Variables**:
- `movementUsedThisTurn`: Total feet moved this turn
- `totalUnlockedMovement`: Total feet unlocked by AP spent
- `movementUnlocked`: Set of tokens that have unlocked movement
- `currentMoveFeet`: Distance of current drag

## Movement AP System Details

### How Movement Tracking Works:

1. **Turn Start**: `movementUsedThisTurn = 0`, `movementUnlocked = false`

2. **First Move** (e.g., 15 ft with 30 speed):
   - Prompts for 1 AP
   - Sets `movementUnlocked = true`
   - Sets `movementUsedThisTurn = 15`
   - Unlocks 30 ft total
   - **Result**: 15 ft remaining free

3. **Second Move** (e.g., 10 ft):
   - No prompt (within 30 ft unlocked)
   - Sets `movementUsedThisTurn = 25`
   - **Result**: 5 ft remaining free

4. **Third Move** (e.g., 20 ft):
   - Prompts for 1 more AP (exceeds 30 ft)
   - Sets `movementUsedThisTurn = 45`
   - Unlocks 60 ft total (2 AP × 30 ft)
   - **Result**: 15 ft remaining free

5. **Turn End**: Resets all tracking

### Key Functions:

- `validateMovement()` - Checks if movement is valid and calculates AP cost
- `confirmMovement()` - Applies AP cost and updates movement tracking
- `getTotalUnlockedMovement()` - Calculates total unlocked movement from AP spent
- `nextTurn()` - Resets movement tracking for new turn

## Notes

The movement AP system was already implemented correctly. The user's description matches exactly how it works:
- 1 AP = creature speed in feet
- Multiple moves within unlocked range = no prompts
- Exceeding unlocked range = prompt for additional AP
- Remaining free movement = unlocked - used

The system uses additive tracking (`totalMovementAfterThis = movementUsedThisTurn + currentMoveFeet`) to ensure all movement is counted correctly across multiple drags.
