# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY NETLIFY FIX - GET YOUR FIXES LIVE NOW

## THE PROBLEM
Netlify is serving OLD SHIT. None of your token fixes or UI improvements are live.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (5 MINUTES)

### STEP 1: Get the Fresh Build
Your fresh build with ALL fixes is ready at:
`C:\Users\Daniel\Desktop\DnD2\vtt-react\build\`

This build contains:
âœ… Token dragging fixes
âœ… Enhanced skills UI  
âœ… All recent improvements
âœ… deployment-test.html (to verify it worked)

### STEP 2: Manual Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the ENTIRE `build` folder from `C:\Users\Daniel\Desktop\DnD2\vtt-react\build\`
3. Drop it on the Netlify page
4. It will give you a new URL like: `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

### STEP 3: Verify It Worked
1. Go to your new Netlify URL
2. Check: `https://your-new-url.netlify.app/deployment-test.html`
3. If you see "ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT TEST - 2025-08-26", IT WORKED!

### STEP 4: Update DNS (Optional)
If you want to keep using windtunnel.netlify.app:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Find the old windtunnel site
3. Delete it or change its name
4. Rename your new site to "windtunnel"

## ALTERNATIVE: Fix Existing Site
If you want to fix the existing windtunnel.netlify.app:
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/windtunnel/settings/deploys
2. Check "Repository" - make sure it's DJ-github88/Descension
3. Check "Branch" - make sure it's master
4. Check "Base directory" - should be vtt-react
5. Check "Build command" - should be npm install && npm run build
6. Check "Publish directory" - should be build
7. Click "Trigger deploy"

## WHY THIS HAPPENED
The existing Netlify site is either:
- Connected to wrong repository
- Using wrong branch
- Has broken build process
- Cached to hell

## BOTTOM LINE
Use the manual drag-and-drop method above. It's guaranteed to work and will have your site live in 2 minutes with ALL your fixes.
