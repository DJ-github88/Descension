# Complete Fixes Summary

## All Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. CSS Conflict - Timeline Icons Misaligned
**Problem**: `.token-icon` in `WizardSteps.css` was globally defined, interfering with combat timeline icons.

**Fix**: Scoped both CSS classes
- `vtt-react/src/components/creature-wizard/styles/WizardSteps.css` (Lines 472-494)
  - Changed to `.wizard-step .token-icon, .token-preview .token-icon`
- `vtt-react/src/styles/combat-system.css` (Lines 783-790)
  - Changed to `.combat-timeline .token-icon, .timeline-token .token-icon`

---

### 2. Character Token Shows "Unknown Character"
**Problem**: `CombatSelectionOverlay` was looking for non-existent `characterTokens` variable.

**Fix**: Added missing imports and used character store
- `vtt-react/src/components/combat/CombatSelectionOverlay.jsx`
  - Added `import useCharacterTokenStore` and `import useCharacterStore`
  - Get `characterTokens` from store
  - Use character store to get character name and icon

---

### 3. Character Token Not in Combat Timeline
**Problem**: `startCombat` only processed tokens with `creatureId`, but character tokens have `playerId`.

**Fix**: Detect character tokens and create creature-like data
- `vtt-react/src/store/combatStore.js` (Lines 59-124)
  - Check if token has `playerId` but no `creatureId`
  - Dynamically import character store
  - Create creature-like object with character stats
  - Set `isCharacterToken` flag

---

### 4. Character Token Movement Validation
**Problem**: `validateMovement` couldn't find creature data for character tokens.

**Fix**: Same approach - get character data when validating
- `vtt-react/src/store/combatStore.js` (Lines 464-487)
  - Check `isCharacterToken` flag
  - Get character data from character store
  - Create creature-like object for validation

---

### 5. Character Token Icon in Timeline
**Problem**: Timeline couldn't get icon for character tokens.

**Fix**: Check `isCharacterToken` and use character store
- `vtt-react/src/components/combat/CombatTimeline.jsx` (Lines 61-82)
  - Check `combatant.isCharacterToken`
  - Dynamically import character store
  - Return character icon or image

---

### 6. Movement Distance Wrong (4000+ ft)
**Problem**: Distance calculated using Euclidean distance on world coordinates.

**Fix**: Use validation result instead
- `vtt-react/src/components/grid/CreatureToken.jsx` (Lines 319-353)
  - Use `validation.currentMovementFeet` instead of manual calculation
  - Pass all required data to dialog including `currentAP`
  - Use correct distance for logging and multiplayer

---

### 7. Movement Visualization Line Misaligned
**Problem**: MovementVisualization was rendered inside CreatureToken with `position: absolute`, making it relative to the token instead of the grid.

**Fix**: Moved rendering to Grid level
- `vtt-react/src/components/Grid.jsx`
  - Added `import MovementVisualization`
  - Added `import useCombatStore`
  - Render MovementVisualization at grid level (after character tokens, before terrain)
  - Get `activeMovement` from combat store
  
- `vtt-react/src/components/grid/CreatureToken.jsx`
  - Removed MovementVisualization rendering
  - Removed import

**Result**: Line now renders at correct position relative to grid, not token!

## What's Fixed

✅ **CSS conflict** - Timeline icons no longer affected by wizard CSS  
✅ **Character token name** - Shows correct name instead of "Unknown Character"  
✅ **Character in timeline** - Character tokens now appear in combat timeline  
✅ **Character icon in timeline** - Shows character's custom icon or image  
✅ **Movement distance** - No more 4000+ ft, uses correct grid-based calculation  
✅ **Current AP** - Dialog shows correct AP value (e.g., 3 instead of 0)  
✅ **Movement visualization line** - Now renders at correct position on grid!

## Technical Details

### Character Token Detection
Character tokens are identified by:
- Has `playerId` property
- Does NOT have `creatureId` property
- May have `isPlayerToken` flag

When detected, we:
1. Dynamically import character store: `require('./characterStore').default`
2. Get current character data: `useCharacterStore.getState()`
3. Create creature-like object with character stats
4. Set `isCharacterToken: true` flag on combatant

### Movement Visualization Positioning
The key issue was that MovementVisualization used `position: absolute` but was rendered inside CreatureToken (which is also absolutely positioned). This made the line position relative to the token, not the grid.

**Solution**: Render at Grid level where `position: absolute` is relative to the grid container.
