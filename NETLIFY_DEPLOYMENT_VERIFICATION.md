- Consider for future optimization

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

### After Netlify Deployment
1. **✅ Open deployed site**: https://windtunnel.netlify.app
2. **✅ Check console for errors**: Should see enhanced multiplayer initialization
3. **✅ Test room creation**: Should work with new services
4. **✅ Test multiplayer**: Open multiple browser instances
5. **✅ Verify performance monitor**: Should show network metrics
6. **✅ Test token movement**: Should be super-fluid with prediction

### Expected Console Messages
```
🚀 Enhanced Multiplayer Client initialized
🔗 Enhanced multiplayer connected
🏠 Room created: [Room Name]
🚪 Room joined: [Room Name]
```

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Before vs After Deployment
| Feature | Before | After Enhanced |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Token Movement** | 150-300ms lag | 50-100ms response |
| **Character Sync** | Manual refresh | Real-time updates |
| **Inventory Sync** | Not available | Instant synchronization |
